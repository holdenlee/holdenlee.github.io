<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Given a sequence of convex functions <span class="math inline">\(f_0, f_1, \ldots, f_T\)</span>, we study the problem of sampling from the Gibbs distribution <span class="math inline">\(\pi_t \propto e^{-\sum_{k=0}^t f_k}\)</span> for each epoch <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in an <em>online</em> manner. Interest in this problem derives from applications in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and optimization where, rather than obtaining all the observations at once, one constantly acquires new data, and must continuously update the distribution. Our main result is an algorithm that generates roughly independent samples from <span class="math inline">\(\pi_t\)</span> for every epoch <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and, under mild assumptions, makes <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{polylog}(T)\)</span> gradient evaluations per epoch. All previous results imply a bound on the number of gradient or function evaluations which is at least linear in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Motivated by real-world applications, we assume that functions are smooth, their associated distributions have a bounded second moment, and their minimizer drifts in a bounded manner, but do not assume they are strongly convex. In particular, our assumptions hold for online Bayesian logistic regression, when the data satisfy natural regularity properties, giving a sampling algorithm with updates that are poly-logarithmic in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. In simulations, our algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to an algorithm specialized to logistic regression. Key to our algorithm is a novel stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics Markov chain with a carefully designed variance reduction step and constant batch size. Technically, lack of strong convexity is a significant barrier to analysis and, here, our main contribution is a martingale exit time argument that shows our Markov chain remains in a ball of radius roughly poly-logarithmic in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> for enough time to reach within <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\pi_t\)</span>.</p>

    <p>The Story of My Life, Helen Keller’s autobiography, is a book which makes me re-appreciate things that I take for granted. It’s amazing how much she can appreciate and accomplish despite being blind and deaf. Her love for learning, and the way that she turns it into play, is inspiring.</p>
<p><a href="https://dynalist.io/d/wW7edPHuU41y1qxWAI0fL__c#z=nHvrND02NZpfWtNO1d23P8mO">Book notes</a></p>
<h2 id="on-learning">On learning</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Gradually I began to find that there were disadvantages in going to college.</p>
<p>The one I felt and still feel most is lack of time. I used to have time to think, to reflect, my mind and I. We would sit together of an evening and listen to the inner melodies of the spirit, which one hears only in leisure moments when the words of some loved poet touch a deep, sweet chord in the soul that until then had been silent. But in college there is no time to commune with one’s thoughts. One goes to college to learn, it seems, not to think. When one enters the portals of learning, one leaves the dearest pleasures–solitude, books and imagination–outside with the whispering pines. I suppose I ought to find some comfort in the thought that I am laying up treasures for future enjoyment, but I am improvident enough to prefer present joy to hoarding riches against a rainy day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many scholars forget, it seems to me, that our enjoyment of the great works of literature depends more upon the depth of our sympathy than upon our understanding. The trouble is that very few of their laborious explanations stick in the memory. The mind drops them as a branch drops its overripe fruit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the precious science of patience, which teaches us that we should take our education as we would take a walk in the country, leisurely, our minds hospitably open to impressions of every sort. Such knowledge floods the soul unseen with a soundless tidal wave of deepening thought. “Knowledge is power.” Rather, knowledge is happiness, because to have knowledge–broad, deep knowledge–is to know true ends from false, and lofty things from low. To know the thoughts and deeds that have marked man’s progress is to feel the great heart-throbs of humanity through the centuries; and if one does not feel in these pulsations a heavenward striving, one must indeed be deaf to the harmonies of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="on-seeing">On seeing</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>People who think that all sensations reach us through the eye and the ear have expressed surprise that I should notice any difference, except possibly the absence of pavements, between walking in city streets and in country roads. They forget that my whole body is alive to the conditions about me. The rumble and roar of the city smite the nerves of my face, and I feel the ceaseless tramp of an unseen multitude, and the dissonant tumult frets my spirit. The grinding of heavy wagons on hard pavements and the monotonous clangour of machinery are all the more torturing to the nerves if one’s attention is not diverted by the panorama that is always present in the noisy streets to people who can see.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As my finger tips trace line and curve, they discover the thought and emotion which the artist has portrayed. I can feel in the faces of gods and heroes hate, courage and love, just as I can detect them in living faces I am permitted to touch. I feel in Diana’s posture the grace and freedom of the forest and the spirit that tames the mountain lion and subdues the fiercest passions. My soul delights in the repose and gracious curves of the Venus; and in Barré’s bronzes the secrets of the jungle are revealed to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The hands of those I meet are dumbly eloquent to me. The touch of some hands is an impertinence. I have met people so empty of joy, that when I clasped their frosty finger tips, it seemed as if I were shaking hands with a northeast storm. Others there are whose hands have sunbeams in them, so that their grasp warms my heart. It may be only the clinging touch of a child’s hand; but there is as much potential sunshine in it for me as there is in a loving glance for others. A hearty handshake or a friendly letter gives me genuine pleasure.</p>

    <p>Many probability distributions that arise in practice are multimodal and hence challenging to sample from. One popular way to overcome this problem is to use <em>temperature-based</em> methods. In this post I describe work with Rong Ge and Andrej Risteski (in NIPS 2018) which gives rigorous guarantees for a temperature-based method called <strong>simulated tempering</strong> when applied to simple multimodal distributions. <!-- I address this problem by proving that a *temperature-based* algorithm efficiently samples from simple multimodal distributions.

<p>We address the following fundamental problem in theoretical computer science and Bayesian machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sample from a probability distribution with density function <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = \frac{e^{-f(x)}}{\int_{\R^n} e^{-f(x)}\,dx}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x\in \R^d\)</span>, given query access to <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f(x)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is convex (we say that the distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is <strong>log-concave</strong>), a classical Markov chain called <strong>Langevin diffusion</strong> gives an efficient way to carry out the sampling. Log-concavity is sampling analogue of convexity, and Langevin diffusion is the analogue of gradient descent: it is gradient descent plus Gaussian noise.</p>
<p>However, just as most interesting optimization problems are non-convex and often have multiple local minima, most intersting sampling problems - such as those arising from deep generative models - are not log-concave, and often have multiple modes. We can’t hope to solve the problem in full generality, but we can hope to find methods that work for a wider class of distributions, including some multimodal distributions. <!-- We show efficient sampling given a structural assumption on the distribution: that it is close to a mixture of gaussians with polynomially many components. --></p>
<h2 id="main-result">Main result</h2>
<!-- The idea is as follows. -->
<p>One general approach to sample from a probability distribution is to define a Markov chain with the desired distribution as its stationary distribution. This approach is called <strong>Markov chain Monte Carlo</strong>.

<p>We cannot use Langevin diffusion by itself because it is a Markov chain with local moves that gets stuck in a local mode.</p>

</center>
<p>Instead, we create a meta-Markov chain (the simulated tempering chain) which <em>changes the temperature</em> to exponentially speed up mixing. To <em>raise the temperature</em> of a distribution means to smooth it out so that the Markov chain can more easily traverse the space. While temperature-based methods have been used heuristically, strong guarantees for them have so far been lacking. <!-- we give guarantees for when it speeds up mixing.--></p>

<p>We show that our algorithm allows efficient sampling given a structural assumption on the distribution: that it is close to a mixture of gaussians (of equal covariance) with polynomially many components. <!-- this is in some sense the prototypical multimodal distribution --></p>

what's wrong with this sentence? 
Sampling is a fundamental task in Bayesian statistics, and dealing with multimodal distributions is a core challenge.  
One common technique to sample from a probability distribution is to define a Markov chain with that distribution as its stationary distribution. This general approach is called **Markov chain Monte Carlo**. However, in many practical problems, the Markov chain does not mix rapidly, and we obtain samples from only one part of the distribution.

Practitioners have dealt with this problem through heuristics involving temperature. *Raising the temperature* of a distribution means smoothing it out in some way, so that it is easier to traverse the space. While these methods are intuitive, there has been little theoretical analysis of such methods. We give general conditions under which one such method, called *simulated tempering*, mixes rapidly, and then show that it can give the first polynomial-time guarantees in a certain multimodal setting.

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The typical scenario of interest in machine learning is sampling from the posterior distribution over the parameters or latent variables in a Bayesian model. Examples include gaussian mixture models, topic models (latent Dirichlet allocation), stochastic block models, and restricted Boltzmann machines. Given a prior <span class="math inline">\(p(h)\)</span> over the parameters or latent variables <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, and a model <span class="math inline">\(p(x|h)\)</span> for how the observables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> are generated from <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, we wish to calculate the posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> after observing many data points <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots, x_N\)</span>. The posterior distribution is given by Bayes’s Rule: <span class="math display">\[p(h|x_1,\ldots, x_N) \propto p(x_1,\ldots, x_N|h)p(h).\]</span></p>
<p>Even for simple models, the posterior is multimodal. Consider the simple example of a mixture of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> gaussians with unknown means <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span> and unit variance, where each point is equally likely to be drawn from each cluster. Suppose we observe data points <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots, x_N\)</span>. Then the posterior update <span class="math inline">\(p(x_1,\ldots, x_n|\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_j)\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{n=1}^N \pa{\sumo jm \rc m \exp\pa{-\fc{\ve{x_n-\mu_j}^2}2}}\)</span>. This expands to a sum of exponentially many gaussians, which is multimodal in the <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span>.</p>
<!--
[^poly]

[^poly]: Because there are exponentially rather than polynomially many gaussians, our theorem does not apply in this case. However, we hope that our techniques may be built upon to provide guarantees for probability distributions which arise in practice.

<h3 id="connections-to-optimization">Connections to optimization</h3>
<!-- Because of various connections between sampling and optimization, the sampling problem is relevant even when the end goal is optimization. 

First, note that t
-->
<p>The story for sampling parallels the story for optimization. In optimization, the problem is to find the minimum of a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <em>convex</em>, there is a unique local minimum, so that local search algorithms like <em>gradient descent</em> are efficient. When <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is non-convex, gradient descent can get trapped in one of many local minima, and the problem is NP-hard in the worst case. However, gradient descent-like algorithms often still well in practice, suggesting that we can achieve better results by taking into account the structure of real-world problems.</p>
<p>Similarly, in sampling, when <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <em>log-concave</em>, the distribution is unimodal and a natural Markov chain called <em>Langevin diffusion</em> (which is gradient descent plus noise) mixes rapidly. When <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is non-log-concave, Langevin diffusion can get trapped in one of many modes, and the problem is #P-hard in the worst case. However, sampling algorithms can still do well in practice, with the aid of heuristics such as temperature-based methods.</p>
<p>Modern sampling problems arising in machine learning are typically non-log-concave. Like in nonconvex optimization, we must go beyond worst case analysis, and find what kind of structure in non-log-concave distributions allows us to sample efficiently.</p>
<p>The main observation connecting optimization and sampling is that if we sample from <span class="math inline">\(e^{-f}\)</span>, we’re more likely to get points where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is small. Thus, sampling is useful even if one is only interested in optimization. <!-- 
The primary connection between optimization and sampling is the following: if we sample from $e^{-f}$, we're more likely to get points where $f$ is small. 
We can take this to the extreme: In the limit as $\beta \to \infty$, the distribution $e^{-\beta f}$ is peaked at exactly the global minima. $\beta$ is called the inverse temperature ($\beta=\frac 1T$) in statistical physics. 
Some connections between optimization and sampling are:
--> Langevin dynamics has been used heuristically to explain the success of SGD, as an optimization algorithm to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05575">escape local minima</a>, and has inspired <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01838">entropy-SGD for optimizing neural networks</a>. The idea of using randomness has also been used to <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2017/07/19/saddle-efficiency/">escape from saddle points</a>. One generic algorithm for online optimization is the multiplicative weights algorithm, which reduces to a sampling problem in the continuous case (<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3972-random-walk-approach-to-regret-minimization">Narayanan et al. 2010</a>). Moreover, there are settings such as online logistic regression in which the only known way to achieve optimal regret is through a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09349">Bayesian sampling approach</a>. <!--and the multiplicative weights algorithm for online optimization in the continuous case [reduces to a sampling problem](...).

<p><strong>Break here if splitting into two posts.

<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>
<p>The two components of our algorithm, Langevin diffusion and simulated tempering.</p>
<h3 id="langevin-diffusion">Langevin diffusion</h3>
<p>Langevin diffusion is a continuous time random-walk for sampling from <span class="math inline">\(p\propto e^{-f}\)</span>, given access to the gradient of the log-pdf, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. It is gradient flow plus Brownian motion, and described by a stochastic differential equation <span class="math display">\[dx_t = -\be_t \nb f(x_t)dt + \sqrt 2 d W_t.\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>-discretized version is where we take a gradient step, with step size <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>, and add gaussian noise scaled by <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2\eta}\)</span>:<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[x_{t+\eta}=x_t-\eta \nb f(x_t) + \sqrt{2\eta}\xi_t.\]</span></p>
<p>Langevin diffusion has been well-studied, both in the math and CS communities. It is a classical result that the stationary distribution is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(e^{-f(x)}\)</span>. Bakry and Emery showed in the 80’s that if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-log-concave, then the mixing time is on the order of <span class="math inline">\(\frac 1{\alpha}\)</span> (see Terence Tao’s <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/some-notes-on-bakry-emery-theory/">blog post</a>).</p>
<p>With the recent algorithmic interest in Langevin diffusion, we want similar guarantees for discretized chain - that it converges to a measure close to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This was done in a series of works including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00095">Dalalyan et al. 2017</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09188">Durmus et al. 2018</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02564">Bubeck et al. 2015</a> who also considered restriction to a convex set. For general distributions <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with some regularity conditions, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03849">Raginsky et al. 2017</a> showede convergence to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in time comparable to continuous dynamics.</p>
<p><em>So why can’t we just run Langevin diffusion?</em></p>
<p>Consider the example of well-separated gaussians. <a href="http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/show_abstract.php?issn=1435-9855%20&amp;vol=6&amp;iss=4&amp;rank=1">Bovier et al. 2004</a> showed, via the theory of metastable processes, that transitioning from one peak to another takes exponential time. Roughly speaking, to estimate the expected time to travel from one mode to the other, consider paths between those modes. The time will be inversely proportional to the maximum, over all paths between the modes, of the minimum probability on the path.</p>
<p>If two gaussians with unit variance have means separated by <span class="math inline">\(2r\)</span>, then any path between them will pass through a point with probability less than <span class="math inline">\(e^{-r^2/2}\)</span>, so it will take on the order of <span class="math inline">\(e^{r^2/2}\)</span> time to move between the gaussians. Think of this as a “energy barrier” Langevin diffusion has to cross. Even if <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is as small as <span class="math inline">\(\log d\)</span>, the time will be superpolynomial in <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="simulated-tempering-turns-the-heat-on">Simulated tempering turns the heat on</h3>
<p>A key observation is that Langevin corresponding to a higher temperature distribution (with <span class="math inline">\(\beta f\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, with inverse temperature <span class="math inline">\(\beta&lt;1\)</span>) mixes faster. A high temperature flattens out the distribution.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>However, we can’t simply run Langevin at a higher temperature because the stationary distribution is wrong. The idea behind simulated tempering is to combine Markov chains at different temperatures, sometimes swapping to another temperature to help lower-temperature chains explore.</p>
<p>We can define simulated tempering with respect to any sequence of Markov chains <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span> on the same space. Think of <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span> as the Markov chain corresponding to temperature <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, with stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(\propto e^{-\beta f_i}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then we define the simulated tempering Markov chain as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>state space</em> is <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> copies of the state space (in our case <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^d\)</span>), one copy for each temperature.</li>
<li>The evolution is defined as follows.
<ul>
<li>If the current point is <span class="math inline">\((i,x)\)</span>, then evolve according to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th chain <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span>.</li>
<li>Propose swaps with some rate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> When a swap is proposed, attempt to move to a neighboring chain, <span class="math inline">\(i'=i\pm 1\)</span>. With probability <span class="math inline">\(\min\{p_{i'}(x)/p_i(x), 1\}\)</span>, the transition is successful. Otherwise, stay at the same point. This is a <strong>Metropolis-Hastings step</strong>; its purpose is to preserve the stationary distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not too hard to see that the stationary distribution is the mixture distribution, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(p(i,x) = \rc L p_i(x)\)</span>. Simulated tempering is popular in practice along with other temperature-based methods such as simulated annealing, parallel tempering, (reverse) annealed importance sampling, and particle filters. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304414902002326">Zheng 2003</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoap/1241702244">Woodard et al. 2009</a> gave decomposition results that can be used to bound mixing time; however in our setting their bound on mixing time is exponential in the number of gaussians.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="combining-langevin-diffusion-and-simulated-tempering">Combining Langevin diffusion and simulated tempering</h3>
<p>Our algorithm is the following. Assume <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=1\)</span> for simplicity.</p>
<p>Take a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>’s starting from <span class="math inline">\(1/D^2\)</span>, going up by factors of <span class="math inline">\(1+1/d\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the ambient dimension) up to 1 and run simulated tempering for Langevin on these temperatures, suitably discretized. Finally, take the samples that are at the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>th temperature.</p>

<h2 id="proof-sketch">Proof sketch</h2>
<p>There are four main steps in the proof.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prove a Markov chain decomposition theorem for distributions, that upper-bounds the mixing time. For discrete/continuous-time Markov chains, this is equivalent to showing a spectral gap/Poincaré inequality.</li>
<li>Show that the conditions of the theorem are satisfied: mixing on component chains, and mixing on a certain projected chain. This shows that the simulated tempering chain mixes, if we move the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span>’s “inside” the mixture of gaussians.

</ol>
<h2 id="markov-chain-decomposition-theorem">Markov chain decomposition theorem</h2>
<h3 id="previous-decomposition-theorems">Previous decomposition theorems</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2699896">Madras and Randall’s theorem</a> says that if a Markov chain M mixes rapidly when restricted to each set of the partition, and the “projected” Markov chain mixes rapidly, then M mixes rapidly. The formal statement is the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem (Madras, Randall 02):</strong> For a (discrete-time) Markov chain <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and a partition <span class="math inline">\(\Om = \bigsqcup_{j=1}^m A_j\)</span> of its state space, <span class="math display">\[\text{Gap}(M) \ge \rc 2 \text{Gap}(\ol M) \min_{1\le j\le m} (\text{Gap}(M|_{A_j})).\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The projected chain <span class="math inline">\(\overline M\)</span> is defined on <span class="math inline">\(\{1,\ldots, m\}\)</span>, and transition probabilities are given by average probability flows between the corresponding sets. More precisely, the probability of transitioning from <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is as follows: pick a random point in <span class="math inline">\(A_j\)</span>, run the Markov chain for one step, and see what’s the probability of landing in <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span>.</p>
<p>This gives a potential plan for the proof. Given a mixture of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> gaussians, suppose we can partition <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^d\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> parts - maybe one centered around each gaussian - such that Langevin mixes rapidly inside each set. Choose the highest temperature so that Langvein mixes well on the entire space <span class="math inline">\(\R^d\)</span> at that temperature.</p>
<center>
<!--img src="pics/sigma_0.5.png"-->
<img src="pics/partition.jpeg" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>
<p>Then if the projected chain also mixes rapidly, this proves the main theorem. Intuitively, the projected chain mixes rapidly because the highest temperature acts like a bridge. There is a reasonable path from any component to any other component passing through the highest temperature.</p>
<p>There are many issues with this approach. The primary problem is defining the partition. Our first proof followed this plan; later we found a simpler proof with better bounds, which I’ll now describe.</p>
<h3 id="decomposition-theorem-with-sets">Decomposition theorem with sets</h3>
<p>The insight is to work with distributions rather than sets.</p>
<p>There’s an idea in math that a theorem is true for sets, then it’s a special case of a theorem for functions - because sets just correspond to indicator functions.</p>
<p>For simulated tempering Langevin on a mixture of Gaussians, we don’t naturally have a decomposition of the state space, we do have a natural decomposition of the stationary distribution - namely the components of the mixture! Think of this as a “soft partition”.</p>
<p>So instead of partitioning <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, we decompose the Markov chain and stationary distribution. We prove a new Markov chain decomposition theorem that allows us to do this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(M_{\text{st}}\)</span> be a simulated tempering Markov chain (with stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) made up of Markov chains <span class="math inline">\(M_i,i\in [L]\)</span>. Suppose there is a decomposition <span class="math display">\[M_i(x,y)=\sum_{j=1}^mw_{ij}M_{ij}(x,y)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}\)</span> has stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(p_{ij}\)</span>. If each <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}\)</span> mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and the projected chain mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(\ol C\)</span>, then the simulated tempering chain mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(O(C(\ol C +1))\)</span>.</p>
The projected chain is defined by
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align} L((i,j),(i,j')) &amp;=
\begin{cases}
\fc{w_{i,j'}}{\chi^2_{\text{sym}}(p_{i,j}||p_{i,j'})},&amp;i=i'\\

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2_{\text{sym}}(p||q)=\max\{\chi^2(p||q),\chi^2(q||p)\}\)</span> is the “symmetrized” <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> divergence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This theorem is where most of the magic lies, but it is also somewhat technical; see the paper for details.</p>
<h3 id="applying-the-decomposition-theorem">Applying the decomposition theorem</h3>
<p>We consider simulated tempering Langevin diffusion for <span class="math display">\[
\wt p_i \propto \sumo jm w_j \ub{\exp\pa{-\fc{\be_i \ve{x-\mu_j}^2}2}}{\wt p_{ij}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The Langevin chain decomposes into Langevin on the mixture components. By the decomposition theorem, if the Markov chain with respect to these components mixes rapidly, and the Markov chain on the “projected” chain mixes rapidly, then the simulated tempering chain mixes rapidly. We verify each of the two conditions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Langevin mixes rapidly for each <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_{ij}\)</span>, in time <span class="math inline">\(O(D^2)\)</span>, by Bakry-Emery, because the highest temperature is <span class="math inline">\(D^2\)</span>.</li>
<li>The projected chain mixes rapidly, in time <span class="math inline">\(O(L^2)\)</span>. To see this, note that by choosing the temperatures close enough, the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> distance between the gaussians in adjacent temperatures is at most a constant, and by choosing the highest temperature high enough, all the gaussians there are also close. Thus, the projected chain looks like <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> stacks of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> nodes, where the nodes in the same stack at adjacent temperatures have probability flow <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(1)\)</span> between them, and the subgraph consisting of nodes at the highest temperature mixes almost immediately.</li>
</ol>
<center>
<img src="pics/proj_chain.png" width="50%" height="50%">

<p>Thus the simulated tempering chain for <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_i\)</span> mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(O(L^2D^2)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="simulated-tempering-mixes-for-p">Simulated tempering mixes for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span></h3>
<p>But we need mixing for simulated tempering where the temperature is outside the sum, <span class="math display">\[
p_i \propto \pa{\sumo jm w_j \exp\pa{-\fc{\ve{x-\mu_j}^2}2}}^{\be_i}.
\]</span> This follows from mixing for <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_i\)</span>, plus the fact that the ratio <span class="math inline">\(p_i/\wt p_i\)</span> is bounded: <span class="math inline">\(\fc{p_i}{\wt p_i}\in [w_{\min}, \rc{w_{\min}}]\)</span>. We lose a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\rc{w_{\min}^2}\)</span>. This finishes the proof of the main result.</p>

<li>There is a spectral decomposition lemma for Markov chains based on decomposing the <em>Markov chain</em> rather than just the <em>state space</em>, and that helps prove mixing for simulated tempering.</li>
<li>Provable sampling holds for a prototypical multimodal distribution: mixture of Gaussians.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="further-directions">Further directions</h2>
<p>Here are further directions and open questions we would like to explore. Feel free to get in touch if you have ideas!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How do we deal with gaussians with different variances? Equal (or approximately equal) variances appear to be necessary in the query model because of the “needle in a haystack” problem: the “attractor region” for a skinny gaussian could be exponentially small. However, other information may help.</li>
<li><p>Carry out average-case analysis for distributions of interest, such as posteriors of mixture models, Ising models, stochastic/censored block models, and RBM’s. These distributions are more complicated than a mixture of gaussians; for example, the posterior for gaussian mixture model is a sum of exponentially many gaussians.</p>
<p>One obstacle is that in many distributions <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of interest, <span class="math inline">\(p\propto e^{-f}\)</span> is not mixture of the probability distribution, but rather, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a combination of simpler functions. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(p\propto e^{-\sum_j w_jf_j}\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(p\propto \sum_j w_j e^{-f_j}\)</span>. When this combination happens in the exponent, the decomposition approach doesn’t work so well.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
It would be great to find other uses for our simulated tempering decomposition theorem - in principle the theorem could even apply when there are exponentially many modes, as long as we create a refining partition such that there is no “bottleneck” at any point.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
<li><p>What are the guarantees for other temperature heuristics used in practice, such as particle filters, annealed importance sampling, and parallel tempering? One undesirable property of simulated tempering is that it incurs a factor of <span class="math inline">\(O(L^2)\)</span> in the running time, where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the number of levels. Particle filters and annealed importance sampling move only from higher to lower temperature, and so only incur a factor of <span class="math inline">\(O(L)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<section class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>For example, we could consider distributions in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^d\)</span>. Here, correlation decay plays a similar role to log-concavity in <span class="math inline">\(\R^n\)</span> in allowing a simple Markov chain, the Gibbs Markov chain, to mix rapidly.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The reason for the square-root scaling is that noise from Brownian motion scales as the square root of the time elapsed (the standard deviation of a sum of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> iid random variables scales as <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span>).<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Changing the temperature is just changing the scaling of the gradient step with respect to the noise.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>This definition is stated for continuous Markov chains. By rate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> I mean that the time between swaps is an exponential distribution with decay <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> (in other words, the times of the swaps forms a Poisson process). A version for discrete Markov chains is to swap with probability <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and to follow the current chain with probability <span class="math inline">\(1-\lambda\)</span>. Note that simulated tempering is traditionally defined for discrete Markov chains, but we will need the continuous version for our proof.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>They proceed by first bounding the spectral gap for parallel tempering, and then showing the gap for simulated tempering is lower-bounded in terms of that. However, in our experience, directly bounding the spectral gap for simulated tempering is easier.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Think of the downstairs combination as an OR combination, the upstairs one as a AND.<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>We stated it in the case where we had the same partition at every level. The more general form of the theorem works even if the partitions on different. The bound could be polynomial even if there are exponentially many components.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>A key task in Bayesian statistics is sampling from distributions that are only specified up to a partition function (i.e., constant of proportionality). However, without any assumptions, sampling (even approximately) can be #P-hard, and few works have provided “beyond worst-case” guarantees for such settings. A key task in Bayesian statistics is sampling from distributions that are only specified up to a partition function (i.e., constant of proportionality). However, without any assumptions, sampling (even approximately) can be #P-hard, and few works have provided “beyond worst-case” guarantees for such settings.</p>
<p>For log-concave distributions, classical results going back to Bakry and Emery (1985) show that natural continuous-time Markov chains called Langevin diffusions mix in polynomial time. The most salient feature of log-concavity violated in practice is uni-modality: commonly, the distributions we wish to sample from are multi-modal. In the presence of multiple deep and well-separated modes, Langevin diffusion suffers from torpid mixing.</p>
<p>We address this problem by combining Langevin diffusion with simulated tempering. The result is a Markov chain that mixes more rapidly by transitioning between different temperatures of the distribution. We analyze this Markov chain for the canonical multi-modal distribution: a mixture of gaussians (of equal variance). The algorithm based on our Markov chain provably samples from distributions that are close to mixtures of gaussians, given access to the gradient of the log-pdf.</p>
<h2 id="blog-post">Blog post</h2>
<p>In this post I describe recent work with Rong Ge and Andrej Risteski on an algorithm that provably samples from certain multimodal distributions.</p>
<p>Sampling is a fundamental task in Bayesian statistics, and dealing with multimodal distributions is a core challenge. One general approach to sample from a probability distribution is to define a Markov chain with the desired distribution as its stationary distribution. This approach is called <strong>Markov chain Monte Carlo</strong>. However, in many practical problems, the Markov chain does not mix rapidly, and we obtain samples from only one part of the distribution.</p>
<p>Practitioners have dealt with this problem through heuristics involving temperature. However, there has been little theoretical analysis of such methods. In our paper, we give provable guarantees for a temperature-based method called simulated tempering when it is set up correctly with the base Markov chain, called Langevin diffusion.</p>
<p>Here is a cartoon of our results:</p>

<p>The concrete problem we address is the following.</p>

<p>Sample from a probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(x) \propto e^{-f(x)}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x\in \R^d\)</span> given access to <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f(x)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can’t hope to solve this problem in full generality<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, but we can hope to find methods that work for a wider class of distributions, including some multimodal distributions.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>First I give some background for the problem.</p>
<!--
* I'll introduce the problem of sampling, a fundamental task of Bayesian statistics. -->
<ul>
<li>I’ll explain the analogy between sampling and optimization, in particular how going beyond <em>convexity</em> in optimization is like going beyond <em>log-concavity</em> in sampling.</li>
<li>I’ll describe some connections between sampling and optimization, hopefully motivating people who work in optimization to care about sampling.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ## The problem of sampling-->
<h3 id="optimization-vs.sampling">Optimization vs. sampling</h3>
<h4 id="the-great-divide-of-optimization">The great divide of optimization</h4>
<p>The goal in optimization is to find the minimum of a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <strong>convex</strong>, this is well-understood:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a unique local minimum, which is a global minimum.</li>
<li>This allows local search algorithms such as <strong>gradient descent</strong> (as well as a whole extended family of zero, first, and second order algorithms) to work.</li>
<li>Well-established mathematics characterizes how fast we can optimize convex functions based on various properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, when <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is non-convex,</p>
<ul>
<li>There can be many bad local minima.</li>
<li>Gradient descent can get trapped in those local minima.</li>
<li>The problem is NP-hard in the worst-case. This is a barrier for theoreticians as it means we won’t have clean, beautiful, assumption-free results, and we’ll have to get our hands dirty.</li>
<li>Still, gradient descent-like algorithms often still well in practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the “great divide” in optimization. On one side we have the well-understood area of convex optimization, and on the other we lump everything under the label “non-convex”. We care about non-convex optimization because many practical optimization problems (such as those arising in machine learning, and deep learning in particular) are very non-convex. In light of the worst-case results we’ll have to get our hands dirty and see what is the structure of real-world problems that allow us to do nonconvex optimization, to close the gap between theory and practice.</p>
<h4 id="the-great-divide-of-sampling">The great divide of sampling</h4>
<p>Analogously we have a “great divide” in sampling.</p>
<p>Recall that we want to sample from <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\in \R^d\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is convex, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is <strong>log-concave</strong>, this is well-understood.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has a unique local minimum, which means the distribution <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is unimodal.</li>
<li>There is a natural algorithm (a Markov chain) called <strong>Langevin diffusion</strong> - which is basically gradient descent plus gaussian noise - that works, and a lot of beautiful math that goes into the analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, when <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is non-convex,</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> can be multimodal</li>
<li>Langevin diffusion can take exponentially long to mix, because it gets trapped in one of the modes.</li>
<li>The problem is #P-hard in the worst case.</li>
<li>Sampling algorithms can still do well in practice, sometimes with the aid of heuristics such as temperature-based methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>We care about this difficult case because modern sampling problems (such as those arising in Bayesian machine learning) are often non-log-concave. Like in nonconvex optimization, we must go beyond worst case analysis, and find what kind of structure in non-log-concave distributions allows us to sample efficiently.</p>
<p>Note that log-concavity makes sense for sampling problems on <span class="math inline">\(\R^d\)</span>, but there are other conditions that similarly give guarantees for mixing, such as <strong>correlation decay</strong> for problems in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^d\)</span>. As is the case for log-concavity, we have provable guarantees for problems satisfying correlation decay, and beyond it, the field is murkier.</p>
<h3 id="why-optimizers-care-about-sampling">Why optimizers care about sampling</h3>
<p>The primary connection between optimization and sampling is the following: if we sample from <span class="math inline">\(e^{-f}\)</span>, we’re more likely to get points where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is small. We can take this to the extreme: In the limit as <span class="math inline">\(\beta \to \infty\)</span>, the distribution <span class="math inline">\(e^{-\beta f}\)</span> is peaked at exactly the global minima. <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is called the inverse temperature (<span class="math inline">\(\beta=\frac 1T\)</span>) in statistical physics.</p>
<p>So in a sense, optimization is “just” a sampling problem. In reality, however, we can’t usually take <span class="math inline">\(\beta\to \infty\)</span>, so there is tradeoff between ability to sample and quality of the solution.</p>
<p>Here is a list of past work connecting optimization and sampling, or more generally, using randomness:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="main-result">Main result</h2>
<p>We analyze a natural algorithm for sampling beyond log-concavity, combining Langevin diffusion with simulated tempering. We show efficient sampling given a structural assumption on the distribution, that it is close to a mixture of gaussians with polynomially many components.</p>
<p>Our main theorem is the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Let <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}\)</span> be a mixture of gaussians, i.e., <span class="math display">\[f(x)=-\ln\pa{\sumo in w_i e^{-\fc{\ve{x-\mu_j}^2}{2\si^2}}}\]</span>. Suppose we can query <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\nb f(x)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\si, \ve{\mu_j}\le D\)</span>. There is an algorithm (based on Langevin diffusion and simulated tempering), which runs in time <span class="math inline">\(\poly(1/w_{\min},1/\si^2,1/\ep,d,D)\)</span> that samples from a distribution <span class="math inline">\(\wt p\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\ve{p-\wt p}_1\le \ep\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, this theorem is robust in the following sense: if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is only <span class="math inline">\(\De\)</span>-close in <span class="math inline">\(L^{\iy}\)</span> distance to a mixture of gaussians, then we incur an additional factor of <span class="math inline">\(\poly(e^{\De})\)</span> in complexity.</p>
<h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
<p>The two algorithmic tools are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Langevin diffusion</strong>, which is a generic chain for sampling given gradient access to log-pdf of distribution, and</li>
<li><strong>Simulated tempering</strong>, a heuristic for speeding up Markov Chains on multimodal distributions.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="langevin-diffusion">Langevin diffusion</h4>
<p>Langevin is a continuous time random-walk for sampling from <span class="math inline">\(p\propto e^{-f}\)</span>, given access to the gradient of the log-pdf, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. It is gradient flow plus Brownian motion, and described by a stochastic differential equation <span class="math display">\[dx_t = -\be_t \nb f(x_t)dt + \sqrt 2 d W_t.\]</span> It’s not necessary to understand the stochastic calculus: you can think of this as the limit of a discrete process, just as gradient flow is the continuous limit of gradient descent. The <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>-discretized version is where we take a gradient step, with step size <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>, and add gaussian noise scaled by <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2\eta}\)</span>:<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[x_{t+\eta}=x_t-\eta \nb f(x_t) + \sqrt{2\eta}\xi_t.\]</span></p>
<p>Langevin diffusion has been well-studied, both in the math and CS communities. It is a classical result that the stationary distribution is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(e^{-f(x)}\)</span>. Bakry and Emery showed in the 80’s that if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-log-concave, then the mixing time is on the order of <span class="math inline">\(\frac 1{\alpha}\)</span> (see Terence Tao’s <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/some-notes-on-bakry-emery-theory/">blog post</a>).</p>
<p>With the recent algorithmic interest in Langevin diffusion, we want similar guarantees for discretized chain - that it converges to a measure close to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This was done by Dalalyan and Durmus and Moulines, and by Bubeck, Eldan, and Lehec, who also considered restriction to a convex set. For general distributions <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with some regularity conditions, Raginsky, Rakhlin, and Telgarsky showed that there is convergence to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in time comparable to continuous dynamics.</p>
<p><em>So why can’t we just run Langevin dynamics?</em></p>
<p>Consider the example of well-separated gaussians. Bovier showed, via the theory of metastable processes, that transitioning from one peak to another takes exponential time. Roughly speaking, to estimate the expected time to travel from one mode to the other, consider paths between those modes. The time will be inversely proportional to the largest possible minimum probability on one of those paths.</p>
<p>If two gaussians with unit variance have means separated by <span class="math inline">\(2r\)</span>, then any path between them will pass through a point with probability less than <span class="math inline">\(e^{-r^2/2}\)</span>, so it will take on the order of <span class="math inline">\(e^{r^2/2}\)</span> time to move between the gaussians. Think of this as a “energy barrier” Langevin diffusion has to cross. Even if <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is as small as <span class="math inline">\(\log d\)</span>, the time will be superpolynomial in <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>

<img src="pics/separated2.png">
</center>
<h4 id="simulated-tempering-turns-the-heat-on">Simulated tempering turns the heat on</h4>
<p>A key observation is that Langevin corresponding to a higher temperature distribution (with <span class="math inline">\(\beta f\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\beta&lt;1\)</span>) mixes faster. A high temperature flattens out the distribution.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>However, we can’t simply run Langevin at a higher temperature because the stationary distribution is wrong. The idea behind simulated tempering is to combine Markov chains at different temperatures, sometimes swapping to another temperature to help lower-temperature chains explore.</p>
<p>We can define simulated tempering with respect to any sequence of Markov chains <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span> on the same space. Think of <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span> as the Markov chain corresponding to temperature <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, with stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(\propto e^{-\beta_i f}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then we define the simulated tempering Markov chain as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>state space</em> is <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> copies of the state space (in our case <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^d\)</span>), one copy for each temperature.</li>
<li>The evolution is defined as follows.
<ul>
<li>If the current point is <span class="math inline">\((i,x)\)</span>, then evolve according to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th chain <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span>.</li>
<li>Propose swaps with some rate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> When a swap is proposed, attempt to move to a neighboring chain, <span class="math inline">\(i'=i\pm 1\)</span>. With probability <span class="math inline">\(\min\{p_{i'}(x)/p_i(x), 1\}\)</span>, the transition is successful. Otherwise, stay at the same point. This is a <strong>Metropolis-Hastings step</strong>; its purpose is to preserve the stationary distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not too hard to see that the stationary distribution is the mixture distribution, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(p(i,x) = \rc L p_i(x)\)</span>. Simulated tempering is popular in practice along with other temperature-based methods such as simulated annealing, parallel tempering, (reverse) annealed importance sampling, and particle filters. Zheng and Woodard, Schmidler, and Huber gave decomposition results that can be used to bound mixing time; however in our setting their bound on mixing time is exponential in the number of gaussians.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="combining-langevin-diffusion-and-simulated-tempering">Combining Langevin diffusion and simulated tempering</h4>
<p>Our algorithm is the following. Assume <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=1\)</span> for simplicity.</p>
<p>Take a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>’s starting from <span class="math inline">\(1/D^2\)</span>, going up by factors of <span class="math inline">\(1+1/d\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the ambient dimension) up to 1 and run simulated tempering for Langevin on these temperatures, suitably discretized. Finally, take the samples that are at the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>th temperature.</p>
<center>
<img src="pics/stl.png" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>
<h2 id="proof-sketch">Proof sketch</h2>
<p>There are four main steps in the proof.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prove a Markov chain decomposition theorem for distributions, that upper-bounds the mixing time. For discrete/continuous-time Markov chains, this is equivalent to showing a spectral gap/Poincaré inequality.</li>
<li>Show that the conditions of the theorem are satisfied: mixing on component chains, and mixing on a certain projected chain. This shows that the simulated tempering chain mixes, if we move the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span>’s “inside” the mixture of gaussians. This makes the stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_i\)</span> at each temperature a mixture of gaussians, so is easier to analyze.</li>
<li>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_i\)</span> are close to the acutal distributions <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span>, so that we also have rapid mixing for the original chain.</li>
<li>Some technical details remain that we won’t cover: bounding the error from discretizing the chain, and estimating the partition functions to within a constant factor.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="markov-chain-decomposition-theorem">Markov chain decomposition theorem</h2>
<h3 id="previous-decomposition-theorems">Previous decomposition theorems</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2699896">Madras and Randall’s theorem</a> says that if a Markov chain M mixes rapidly when restricted to each set of the partition, and the “projected” Markov chain mixes rapidly, then M mixes rapidly. The formal statement is the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem (Madras, Randall 02):</strong> For a (discrete-time) Markov chain <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and a partition <span class="math inline">\(\Om = \bigsqcup_{j=1}^m A_j\)</span> of its state space, <span class="math display">\[\text{Gap}(M) \ge \rc 2 \text{Gap}(\ol M) \min_{1\le j\le m} (\text{Gap}(M|_{A_j})).\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The projected chain <span class="math inline">\(\overline M\)</span> is defined on <span class="math inline">\(\{1,\ldots, m\}\)</span>, and transition probabilities are given by average probability flows between the corresponding sets. More precisely, the probability of transitioning from <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is as follows: pick a random point in <span class="math inline">\(A_j\)</span>, run the Markov chain for one step, and see what’s the probability of landing in <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span>.</p>
<p>This gives a potential plan for the proof. Given a mixture of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> gaussians, suppose we can partition <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^d\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> parts - maybe one centered around each gaussian - such that Langevin mixes rapidly inside each set. Choose the highest temperature so that Langvein mixes well on the entire space <span class="math inline">\(\R^d\)</span> at that temperature.</p>
<center>
<!--img src="pics/sigma_0.5.png"-->
<img src="pics/partition.jpeg" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>
<p>Then if the projected chain also mixes rapidly, this proves the main theorem. Intuitively, the projected chain mixes rapidly because the highest temperature acts like a bridge. There is a reasonable path from any component to any other component passing through the highest temperature.</p>
<p>There are many issues with this approach. The primary problem is defining the partition. While there is a way to make this work, we found a simpler proof with better bounds, which I’ll now describe.</p>
<h3 id="decomposition-theorem-with-sets">Decomposition theorem with sets</h3>
<p>The insight is to work with distributions rather than sets.</p>
<p>There’s an idea in math that a theorem is true for sets, then it’s a special case of a theorem for functions - because sets just correspond to indicator functions.</p>
<p>For simulated tempering Langevin on a mixture of Gaussians, we don’t naturally have a decomposition of the state space, we do have a natural decomposition of the stationary distribution - namely the components of the mixture! Think of this as a “soft partition”.</p>
<p>So instead of partitioning <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, we decompose the Markov chain and stationary distribution. We prove a new Markov chain decomposition theorem that allows us to do this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(M_{\text{st}}\)</span> be a simulated tempering Markov chain (with stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) made up of Markov chains <span class="math inline">\(M_i,i\in [L]\)</span>. Suppose there is a decomposition <span class="math display">\[M_i(x,y)=\sum_{j=1}^mw_{ij}M_{ij}(x,y)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}\)</span> has stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(p_{ij}\)</span>. If each <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}\)</span> mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and the projected chain mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(\ol C\)</span>, then the simulated tempering chain mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(O(C(\ol C +1))\)</span>.</p>
The projected chain is defined by
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align} L((i,j),(i,j')) &amp;=
\begin{cases}
\fc{w_{i,j'}}{\chi^2_{\text{sym}}(p_{i,j}||p_{i,j'})},&amp;i=i'\\
\fc{\min\bc{\frac{w_{i',j}}{w_{i,j}},1}}{\chi^2_{\text{sym}}(p_{i,j}||p_{i',j'}))}
,&amp;i'=i\pm 1\\
0,&amp;\text{else.}
\end{cases}
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2_{\text{sym}}(p||q)=\max\{\chi^2(p||q),\chi^2(q||p)\}\)</span> is the “symmetrized” <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> divergence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This theorem is where most of the magic lies, but it is also somewhat technical; see the paper for details. <!--so you can skip it on a first read.--></p>
<h3 id="applying-the-decomposition-theorem">Applying the decomposition theorem</h3>
<p>We consider simulated tempering Langevin diffusion for <span class="math display">\[
\wt p_i \propto \sumo jm w_j \ub{\exp\pa{-\fc{\be_i \ve{x-\mu_j}^2}2}}{\wt p_{ij}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The Langevin chain decomposes into Langevin on the mixture components. By the decomposition theorem, if the Markov chain with respect to these components mixes rapidly, and the Markov chain on the “projected” chain mixes rapidly, then the simulated tempering chain mixes rapidly. We verify each of the two conditions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Langevin mixes rapidly for each <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_{ij}\)</span>, in time <span class="math inline">\(O(D^2)\)</span>, by Bakry-Emery, because the highest temperature is <span class="math inline">\(D^2\)</span>.</li>
<li>The projected chain mixes rapidly, in time <span class="math inline">\(O(L^2)\)</span>. To see this, note that by choosing the temperatures close enough, the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> distance between the gaussians in adjacent temperatures is at most a constant, and by choosing the highest temperature high enough, all the gaussians there are also close. Thus, the projected chain looks like <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> stacks of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> nodes, where the nodes in the same stack at adjacent temperatures have probability flow <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(1)\)</span> between them, and the subgraph consisting of nodes at the highest temperature mixes almost immediately.</li>
</ol>
<center>
<img src="pics/proj_chain.png" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>
<p>Thus the simulated tempering chain for <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_i\)</span> mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(O(L^2D^2)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="simulated-tempering-mixes-for-p">Simulated tempering mixes for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span></h3>
<p>But we need mixing for simulated tempering where the temperature is outside the sum, <span class="math display">\[
p_i \propto \pa{\sumo jm w_j \exp\pa{-\fc{\ve{x-\mu_j}^2}2}}^{\be_i}.
\]</span> This follows from mixing for <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_i\)</span>, plus the fact that the ratio $ p_i/p_i$ is bounded: <span class="math inline">\(\fc{p_i}{\wt p_i}\in [w_{\min}, \rc{w_{\min}}]\)</span>. We lose a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\rc{w_{\min}^2}\)</span>. This finishes the proof of the main result.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Beyond log-concavity” for sampling is the analogue of “beyond convexity” for optimization.</li>
<li>There is a spectral decomposition lemma for Markov chains based on decomposing the <em>Markov chain</em> rather than just the <em>state space</em>, and that helps prove mixing for simulated tempering.</li>
<li>Provable sampling holds for a prototypical multimodal distribution: mixture of Gaussians.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="further-directions">Further directions</h2>
<p>Here are further directions and open questions we would like to explore. Feel free to get in touch if you have ideas!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How do we deal with gaussians with different variance?
<ul>
<li>You might have wondered why we needed the gaussians to have the same covariance, and how robust the results are to different covariances. We can allow the variances to be at most a factor of <span class="math inline">\(1+\fc Cd\)</span> apart in each direction. In general different variances have the problem that they change the mixture coefficients at the different levels - for a skinny gaussian, it could be exponentially small at the highest temperature, and large at the lowest temperature. Thus it’s hard to even get into the “attractor region” for that gaussian at the highest temperature - like finding a needle in a haystack. One assumption we can use to get around this is to assume we’re given points near each of the modes. Then we can hope to have an unbiased sample by combining the samples starting from each of those modes, with the right coefficients.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find practical algorithms for testing whether a Markov chain has mixed.</li>
<li>Carry out average-case analysis for distributions of interest.
<ul>
<li><p>In real-life, the distributions we want to sample from are not as simple as a polynomial mixture of gaussians. For example, consider clustering. Suppose a simple model, that there are m clusters, each has some mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span>, and each point is equally likely to be drawn from each cluster. Then the posterior distribution looks like a product of sums <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{n=1}^N \pa{\sumo jm \rc m \exp\pa{-\fc{\ve{x_n-\mu_j}^2}2}}\)</span>, which when expanded out, has exponentially many terms, so our results don’t immediately apply.</p>
<p>One obstacle is that in many distributions <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of interest, <span class="math inline">\(p\propto e^{-f}\)</span> is not mixture of the probability distribution, but rather, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a combination of simpler functions. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(p\propto e^{-\sum_j w_jf_j}\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(p\propto \sum_j w_j e^{-f_j}\)</span>. When this combination happens in the exponent, the decomposition approach doesn’t work so well.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Can we come up with provable results for Ising models, stochastic/censored block models, or RBM’s?</p>
It would be great to find other uses for our simulated tempering decomposition theorem - in principle the theorem could even apply when there are exponentially many modes, as long as we create a refining partition such that there is no “bottleneck” at any point.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the guarantees for other temperature heuristics used in practice, such as particle filters, annealed importance sampling, and parallel tempering? One undesirable property of simulated tempering is that it incurs a factor of <span class="math inline">\(O(L^2)\)</span> in the running time, where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the number of levels. Particle filters and annealed importance sampling move only from higher to lower temperature, and so only incur a factor of <span class="math inline">\(O(L)\)</span>. The analysis would be different because they are no longer Markov chains on <span class="math inline">\([L]\times \Om\)</span>, but similar decomposition theorems may hold.</li>

# Introduction

Summary:

* I compare sampling to *optimization*. "Beyond log-concavity" is the analogue of "beyond convexity" in the Bayesian world. Moreover, there are close connections between optimization and sampling, so there's reason to study sampling even if you only care about optimization.
* Sampling is a fundamental task in Bayesian statistics.
* To help with sampling, temperature-based methods are widely used, but lack theoretical analysis.

## Optimization vs. sampling

The goal in optimization is to find the minimum of a function $f$. 

When $f$ is convex, this is well-understood and can be solved using local search algorithms such as gradient descent.

When $f$ is non-convex, the problem is NP-hard in the worst-case, but algorithms often work well in practice.

Here is a comparison of convex and non-convex optimization, the "great divide" of optimization.

| Convex optimization | Non-convex optimization |
| --- | --- |
| Local minimum = global minima | Possibly bad local minima |
| Gradient descent finds global minimum | Gradient descent can be bad |
| Provable algorithms with beautiful mathematics | NP-hard in the worst-case (messy), but often works in practice |
| | Modern optimization problems (e.g. machine learning) are often non-convex.|

    <p>Read. You can’t count on others to tell you what to read. There are many books I’ve read that changed my views that I wished I’d read earlier. Reading for pleasure is good, but also read strategically. Go out of your way to figure out a list of books that are important and for what reasons, and read some of them. Sometimes adults will just tell you to read, but not try and pick the best books for you to read. In particular, adults have a tendency to just push story-books they feel are age-appropriate. Read nonfiction, or fiction with Views. Don’t believe what you read. Read things you disagree with. Read Ayn Rand and Karl Marx, and then form your own opinion. Especially read about big ideas. Read life advice by successful people. Your brain will feel exploded afterwards, and you’ll feel paralyzed for a while afterwards (if you’re anything like me), so maybe don’t do this too often, but you want to know all your options and possible strategies early. Find things to follow, like blogs with ideas, debates. You don’t have to follow them consistently - I regularly go for extended periods where I consume little media, because that makes it easier to focus - but know they’re there.</p>
<p>Strategize your distractions. It’s hard to be productive every minute - and distractions smoothen life out. The key is to have high-quality distractions. Ex. reddit front page rarely has anything meaningful, you could instead look at subreddits that pertain to your interest. Find the distractions that are meaningful to you, like webcomics and blogs. These are high-quality distractions. Low-quality distractions are things like checking your email every few minutes.</p>
<p>Your job isn’t to know what you want to do: it’s to get yourself exposed to interesting things, to things that are beautiful and to things that give you power (ex. knowledge).</p>
<p>Develop taste. Don’t just do things. Don’t just play computer games. If you like computer games, play good computer games. Find the games that have really creative storytelling, or really good mechanics, or are revolutionary in some way.</p>
<p>Do projects. Have experience in coming up with an idea or initiative you want to pursue, and then pursuing it - rather than just doing something someone told you to do.</p>
<p>Develop a love for learning. A love for learning means you’ll learn, even when no one recognizes you for it - when you don’t win competitions, when you don’t get certificates or badges. Some people were born with this love; some had it instilled in them from their family or community. But even if you haven’t, you can still develop it. It’s not easy. Pride is dangerous: beware of taking too much pleasure in doing something well. A litmus test is would you still do it if you didn’t get the recognition? Many people hit a wall in college: they didn’t realize all the hidden motivations that compelled them to learn (ex. being better than other people), and these motivations dry up (ex. they are suddenly not better than everyone else around them). The solution is to have motivations to learn that won’t dry up. Find them. It’s fine to be motivated by pride and competition - but make sure you have something more substantial to lean on. Get off your crutches early. Know that love for learning often doesn’t come automatically, but it is a very rewarding thing to develop.</p>
<p>Learn different things. You don’t have to cover everything - you can’t cover everything. But learn different things. The first step in learning something, unless you have a good sense of it already, is not to pick a random textbook and start reading. People are passionate about subjects for a reason - figure out what it is that makes them tick. Figure out what is “good work” in the subject. Figure out what are the books, classes, exercises, and projects that will help you learn the subject, based on your experience. This used to be much harder, but now there’s the Internet. There are many recommendations online, many online courses and course materials to pursue. Sometimes the official sources - ex. textbooks - are hard to penetrate. Find other sources - blog posts, videos, whatever. There are many roads. Don’t dismiss entire subjects as “not interesting.” You can dismiss them as “not my focus right now.” Think of every subject and contemplate on it a little. What are the “classics”? Why do people study them? Ask these questions. Figure out why these subjects are interesting, why they are worth learning, and then you can make your decisions on what to focus on learning. It’s much, much easier to explore things earlier than later. When your interests change, don’t force them to stay on the same track. Keep your life plans flexible. When you have doubts about whether you want to do X or Y, remember that doubts grow when suppressed. Doubts want to either annihilate the object of doubt, or be annihilated. So try out that other thing, and you’ll know which is the outcome. Either is better than suppressed doubt.</p>
<p>Write everything down. Figure out (after some experimentation) a consistent way to take notes so that you can search up anything important you’ve ever learned. (I recommend <a href="https://workflowy.com/invite/fdc650b.lnx">workflowy</a> or <a href="https://dynalist.io/invite/6Chr2g">dynalist</a>, but there are many options: OneNote, EverNote, etc.) You can learn things halfway and then pick up where you left off. “Disorganization” is not a unchangeable trait. Fix it. People underutilize the organizational and remembering power of computers, or even paper and pencil. Carry a notebook, and write down things to remember. Don’t just absorb and copy. Write things in your own words. Write down your questions. Questions are the knives that cut through the curtain of life. Find opportunities to ask the questions that you write down. Write down the answers when you find them.</p>
