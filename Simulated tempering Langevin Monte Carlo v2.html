    <p>Many probability distributions that arise in practice are multimodal and hence challenging to sample from. One popular way to overcome this problem is to use <em>temperature-based</em> methods. In this post I describe work with Rong Ge and Andrej Risteski (in NIPS 2018) which gives rigorous guarantees for a temperature-based method called <strong>simulated tempering</strong> when applied to simple multimodal distributions. <!-- I address this problem by proving that a *temperature-based* algorithm efficiently samples from simple multimodal distributions.
In this post I describe work with Rong Ge and Andrej Risteski on an algorithm that provably samples from certain multimodal distributions. --> For more information, check out the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02736">paper</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/44udkqyd2r95qzk/slides_IAS.pdf?dl=0">slides</a>, <a href="https://dynalist.io/d/wW7edPHuU41y1qxWAI0fL__c#z=c2y7iGMb-rjqoGupMLQ1DAWe">talk transcript</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nvh4g055lyx9yth/poster_bayesian.pdf?dl=0">poster</a>.</p>
<p>We address the following fundamental problem in theoretical computer science and Bayesian machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sample from a probability distribution with density function <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = \frac{e^{-f(x)}}{\int_{\R^n} e^{-f(x)}\,dx}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x\in \R^d\)</span>, given query access to <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f(x)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is convex (we say that the distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is <strong>log-concave</strong>), a classical Markov chain called <strong>Langevin diffusion</strong> gives an efficient way to carry out the sampling. Log-concavity is sampling analogue of convexity, and Langevin diffusion is the analogue of gradient descent: it is gradient descent plus Gaussian noise.</p>
<p>However, just as most interesting optimization problems are non-convex and often have multiple local minima, most intersting sampling problems - such as those arising from deep generative models - are not log-concave, and often have multiple modes. We can’t hope to solve the problem in full generality, but we can hope to find methods that work for a wider class of distributions, including some multimodal distributions. <!-- We show efficient sampling given a structural assumption on the distribution: that it is close to a mixture of gaussians with polynomially many components. --></p>
<h2 id="main-result">Main result</h2>
<!-- The idea is as follows. -->
<p>One general approach to sample from a probability distribution is to define a Markov chain with the desired distribution as its stationary distribution. This approach is called <strong>Markov chain Monte Carlo</strong>. However, in many practical problems, the Markov chain does not mix rapidly, and we obtain samples from only one part of the distribution.</p>
<!-- We use two algorithmic tools: -->
<p>Thus, our algorithm requires two ingredients:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Langevin diffusion</strong>, which is a generic chain for sampling given gradient access to the log-pdf of the distribution, and</li>
<li><strong>Simulated tempering</strong>, a heuristic for speeding up Markov Chains on multimodal distributions.</li>
</ol>
<p>We cannot use Langevin diffusion by itself because it is a Markov chain with local moves that gets stuck in a local mode.</p>
<center>
<img src="pics/not_mixing.png" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>
<p>Instead, we create a meta-Markov chain (the simulated tempering chain) which <em>changes the temperature</em> to exponentially speed up mixing. To <em>raise the temperature</em> of a distribution means to smooth it out so that the Markov chain can more easily traverse the space. While temperature-based methods have been used heuristically, strong guarantees for them have so far been lacking. <!-- we give guarantees for when it speeds up mixing.--></p>

<!-- A common heuristic approach to deal with multimodal distribution is *temperature-based methods*. These methods depend on *raising the temperature* of the distribution, i.e., smoothing it out in some way, so that the Markov chain can more easily traverse the space. We use one such method, called **simulated tempering**. -->
<p>We show that our algorithm allows efficient sampling given a structural assumption on the distribution: that it is close to a mixture of gaussians (of equal covariance) with polynomially many components. <!-- this is in some sense the prototypical multimodal distribution --></p>
<p>Our main theorem is the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Let <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}\)</span> be a mixture of gaussians, i.e., <span class="math display">\[f(x)=-\log\pa{\sumo in w_i e^{-\fc{\ve{x-\mu_j}^2}{2\si^2}}}.\]</span> Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\si, \ve{\mu_j}\le D\)</span> and we can query <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\nb f(x)\)</span>. There is an algorithm (based on Langevin diffusion and simulated tempering), which runs in time <span class="math inline">\(\poly(1/w_{\min},1/\si^2,1/\ep,d,D)\)</span> and samples from a distribution <span class="math inline">\(\wt p\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\ve{p-\wt p}_1\le \ep\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, this theorem is robust in the following sense: if <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is a factor of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> away from a mixture of gaussians, then we incur an additional factor of <span class="math inline">\(\poly(K)\)</span> in running time. The theorem also extends to a mixture of strongly log-concave distributions of the same shape; we discuss the gaussian case for simplicity.</p>
<p>The main technical ingredient is a theorem giving criteria under which a simulated tempering Markov chain mixes. This is not tied to Langevin diffusion, and can also be applied to Markov chains on other spaces.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Below, I give some motivation for the problem, describe the algorithm that we use, and sketch the proof of the theorem.</p>

what's wrong with this sentence? 
Sampling is a fundamental task in Bayesian statistics, and dealing with multimodal distributions is a core challenge.  
One common technique to sample from a probability distribution is to define a Markov chain with that distribution as its stationary distribution. This general approach is called **Markov chain Monte Carlo**. However, in many practical problems, the Markov chain does not mix rapidly, and we obtain samples from only one part of the distribution.

Practitioners have dealt with this problem through heuristics involving temperature. *Raising the temperature* of a distribution means smoothing it out in some way, so that it is easier to traverse the space. While these methods are intuitive, there has been little theoretical analysis of such methods. We give general conditions under which one such method, called *simulated tempering*, mixes rapidly, and then show that it can give the first polynomial-time guarantees in a certain multimodal setting. 
-->
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The typical scenario of interest in machine learning is sampling from the posterior distribution over the parameters or latent variables in a Bayesian model. Examples include gaussian mixture models, topic models (latent Dirichlet allocation), stochastic block models, and restricted Boltzmann machines. Given a prior <span class="math inline">\(p(h)\)</span> over the parameters or latent variables <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, and a model <span class="math inline">\(p(x|h)\)</span> for how the observables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> are generated from <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, we wish to calculate the posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> after observing many data points <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots, x_N\)</span>. The posterior distribution is given by Bayes’s Rule: <span class="math display">\[p(h|x_1,\ldots, x_N) \propto p(x_1,\ldots, x_N|h)p(h).\]</span></p>
<p>Even for simple models, the posterior is multimodal. Consider the simple example of a mixture of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> gaussians with unknown means <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span> and unit variance, where each point is equally likely to be drawn from each cluster. Suppose we observe data points <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots, x_N\)</span>. Then the posterior update <span class="math inline">\(p(x_1,\ldots, x_n|\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_j)\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{n=1}^N \pa{\sumo jm \rc m \exp\pa{-\fc{\ve{x_n-\mu_j}^2}2}}\)</span>. This expands to a sum of exponentially many gaussians, which is multimodal in the <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span>.</p>
<!--
[^poly]

[^poly]: Because there are exponentially rather than polynomially many gaussians, our theorem does not apply in this case. However, we hope that our techniques may be built upon to provide guarantees for probability distributions which arise in practice.

<h3 id="connections-to-optimization">Connections to optimization</h3>
<!-- Because of various connections between sampling and optimization, the sampling problem is relevant even when the end goal is optimization. 

First, note that t
-->
<p>The story for sampling parallels the story for optimization. In optimization, the problem is to find the minimum of a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <em>convex</em>, there is a unique local minimum, so that local search algorithms like <em>gradient descent</em> are efficient. When <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is non-convex, gradient descent can get trapped in one of many local minima, and the problem is NP-hard in the worst case. However, gradient descent-like algorithms often still well in practice, suggesting that we can achieve better results by taking into account the structure of real-world problems.</p>
<p>Similarly, in sampling, when <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <em>log-concave</em>, the distribution is unimodal and a natural Markov chain called <em>Langevin diffusion</em> (which is gradient descent plus noise) mixes rapidly. When <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is non-log-concave, Langevin diffusion can get trapped in one of many modes, and the problem is #P-hard in the worst case. However, sampling algorithms can still do well in practice, with the aid of heuristics such as temperature-based methods.</p>
<p>Modern sampling problems arising in machine learning are typically non-log-concave. Like in nonconvex optimization, we must go beyond worst case analysis, and find what kind of structure in non-log-concave distributions allows us to sample efficiently.</p>
<p>The main observation connecting optimization and sampling is that if we sample from <span class="math inline">\(e^{-f}\)</span>, we’re more likely to get points where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is small. Thus, sampling is useful even if one is only interested in optimization. <!-- 
The primary connection between optimization and sampling is the following: if we sample from $e^{-f}$, we're more likely to get points where $f$ is small. 
We can take this to the extreme: In the limit as $\beta \to \infty$, the distribution $e^{-\beta f}$ is peaked at exactly the global minima. $\beta$ is called the inverse temperature ($\beta=\frac 1T$) in statistical physics. 
Some connections between optimization and sampling are:
--> Langevin dynamics has been used heuristically to explain the success of SGD, as an optimization algorithm to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05575">escape local minima</a>, and has inspired <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01838">entropy-SGD for optimizing neural networks</a>. The idea of using randomness has also been used to <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2017/07/19/saddle-efficiency/">escape from saddle points</a>. One generic algorithm for online optimization is the multiplicative weights algorithm, which reduces to a sampling problem in the continuous case (<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3972-random-walk-approach-to-regret-minimization">Narayanan et al. 2010</a>). Moreover, there are settings such as online logistic regression in which the only known way to achieve optimal regret is through a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09349">Bayesian sampling approach</a>. <!--and the multiplicative weights algorithm for online optimization in the continuous case [reduces to a sampling problem](...). LINK--></p>
<p><strong>Break here if splitting into two posts. In the next post I describe our algorithm and give a sketch of the main proof. / Continuing the previous post, I now describe our algorithm to sample from multimodal distributions <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}\)</span>, given query access to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>
<p>The two components of our algorithm, Langevin diffusion and simulated tempering.</p>
<h3 id="langevin-diffusion">Langevin diffusion</h3>
<p>Langevin diffusion is a continuous time random-walk for sampling from <span class="math inline">\(p\propto e^{-f}\)</span>, given access to the gradient of the log-pdf, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. It is gradient flow plus Brownian motion, and described by a stochastic differential equation <span class="math display">\[dx_t = -\be_t \nb f(x_t)dt + \sqrt 2 d W_t.\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>-discretized version is where we take a gradient step, with step size <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>, and add gaussian noise scaled by <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2\eta}\)</span>:<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[x_{t+\eta}=x_t-\eta \nb f(x_t) + \sqrt{2\eta}\xi_t.\]</span></p>
<p>Langevin diffusion has been well-studied, both in the math and CS communities. It is a classical result that the stationary distribution is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(e^{-f(x)}\)</span>. Bakry and Emery showed in the 80’s that if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-log-concave, then the mixing time is on the order of <span class="math inline">\(\frac 1{\alpha}\)</span> (see Terence Tao’s <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/some-notes-on-bakry-emery-theory/">blog post</a>).</p>
<p>With the recent algorithmic interest in Langevin diffusion, we want similar guarantees for discretized chain - that it converges to a measure close to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This was done in a series of works including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00095">Dalalyan et al. 2017</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09188">Durmus et al. 2018</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02564">Bubeck et al. 2015</a> who also considered restriction to a convex set. For general distributions <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with some regularity conditions, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03849">Raginsky et al. 2017</a> showede convergence to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in time comparable to continuous dynamics.</p>
<p><em>So why can’t we just run Langevin diffusion?</em></p>
<p>Consider the example of well-separated gaussians. <a href="http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/show_abstract.php?issn=1435-9855%20&amp;vol=6&amp;iss=4&amp;rank=1">Bovier et al. 2004</a> showed, via the theory of metastable processes, that transitioning from one peak to another takes exponential time. Roughly speaking, to estimate the expected time to travel from one mode to the other, consider paths between those modes. The time will be inversely proportional to the maximum, over all paths between the modes, of the minimum probability on the path.</p>
<p>If two gaussians with unit variance have means separated by <span class="math inline">\(2r\)</span>, then any path between them will pass through a point with probability less than <span class="math inline">\(e^{-r^2/2}\)</span>, so it will take on the order of <span class="math inline">\(e^{r^2/2}\)</span> time to move between the gaussians. Think of this as a “energy barrier” Langevin diffusion has to cross. Even if <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is as small as <span class="math inline">\(\log d\)</span>, the time will be superpolynomial in <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<center>
<img src="pics/separated2.png">
</center>
<h3 id="simulated-tempering-turns-the-heat-on">Simulated tempering turns the heat on</h3>
<p>A key observation is that Langevin corresponding to a higher temperature distribution (with <span class="math inline">\(\beta f\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, with inverse temperature <span class="math inline">\(\beta&lt;1\)</span>) mixes faster. A high temperature flattens out the distribution.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>However, we can’t simply run Langevin at a higher temperature because the stationary distribution is wrong. The idea behind simulated tempering is to combine Markov chains at different temperatures, sometimes swapping to another temperature to help lower-temperature chains explore.</p>
<p>We can define simulated tempering with respect to any sequence of Markov chains <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span> on the same space. Think of <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span> as the Markov chain corresponding to temperature <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, with stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(\propto e^{-\beta f_i}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then we define the simulated tempering Markov chain as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>state space</em> is <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> copies of the state space (in our case <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^d\)</span>), one copy for each temperature.</li>
<li>The evolution is defined as follows.
<ul>
<li>If the current point is <span class="math inline">\((i,x)\)</span>, then evolve according to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th chain <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span>.</li>
<li>Propose swaps with some rate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> When a swap is proposed, attempt to move to a neighboring chain, <span class="math inline">\(i'=i\pm 1\)</span>. With probability <span class="math inline">\(\min\{p_{i'}(x)/p_i(x), 1\}\)</span>, the transition is successful. Otherwise, stay at the same point. This is a <strong>Metropolis-Hastings step</strong>; its purpose is to preserve the stationary distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not too hard to see that the stationary distribution is the mixture distribution, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(p(i,x) = \rc L p_i(x)\)</span>. Simulated tempering is popular in practice along with other temperature-based methods such as simulated annealing, parallel tempering, (reverse) annealed importance sampling, and particle filters. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304414902002326">Zheng 2003</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoap/1241702244">Woodard et al. 2009</a> gave decomposition results that can be used to bound mixing time; however in our setting their bound on mixing time is exponential in the number of gaussians.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="combining-langevin-diffusion-and-simulated-tempering">Combining Langevin diffusion and simulated tempering</h3>
<p>Our algorithm is the following. Assume <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=1\)</span> for simplicity.</p>
<p>Take a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>’s starting from <span class="math inline">\(1/D^2\)</span>, going up by factors of <span class="math inline">\(1+1/d\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the ambient dimension) up to 1 and run simulated tempering for Langevin on these temperatures, suitably discretized. Finally, take the samples that are at the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>th temperature.</p>
<center>
<img src="pics/stl.png" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>
<h2 id="proof-sketch">Proof sketch</h2>
<p>There are four main steps in the proof.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prove a Markov chain decomposition theorem for distributions, that upper-bounds the mixing time. For discrete/continuous-time Markov chains, this is equivalent to showing a spectral gap/Poincaré inequality.</li>
<li>Show that the conditions of the theorem are satisfied: mixing on component chains, and mixing on a certain projected chain. This shows that the simulated tempering chain mixes, if we move the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span>’s “inside” the mixture of gaussians. This makes the stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_i\)</span> at each temperature a mixture of gaussians, so is easier to analyze.</li>
<li>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_i\)</span> are close to the acutal distributions <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span>, so that we also have rapid mixing for the original chain.</li>
<li>Some technical details remain that we won’t cover: bounding the error from discretizing the chain, and estimating the partition functions to within a constant factor.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="markov-chain-decomposition-theorem">Markov chain decomposition theorem</h2>
<h3 id="previous-decomposition-theorems">Previous decomposition theorems</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2699896">Madras and Randall’s theorem</a> says that if a Markov chain M mixes rapidly when restricted to each set of the partition, and the “projected” Markov chain mixes rapidly, then M mixes rapidly. The formal statement is the following.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem (Madras, Randall 02):</strong> For a (discrete-time) Markov chain <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and a partition <span class="math inline">\(\Om = \bigsqcup_{j=1}^m A_j\)</span> of its state space, <span class="math display">\[\text{Gap}(M) \ge \rc 2 \text{Gap}(\ol M) \min_{1\le j\le m} (\text{Gap}(M|_{A_j})).\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The projected chain <span class="math inline">\(\overline M\)</span> is defined on <span class="math inline">\(\{1,\ldots, m\}\)</span>, and transition probabilities are given by average probability flows between the corresponding sets. More precisely, the probability of transitioning from <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is as follows: pick a random point in <span class="math inline">\(A_j\)</span>, run the Markov chain for one step, and see what’s the probability of landing in <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span>.</p>
<p>This gives a potential plan for the proof. Given a mixture of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> gaussians, suppose we can partition <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^d\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> parts - maybe one centered around each gaussian - such that Langevin mixes rapidly inside each set. Choose the highest temperature so that Langvein mixes well on the entire space <span class="math inline">\(\R^d\)</span> at that temperature.</p>

</center>
<p>Then if the projected chain also mixes rapidly, this proves the main theorem. Intuitively, the projected chain mixes rapidly because the highest temperature acts like a bridge. There is a reasonable path from any component to any other component passing through the highest temperature.</p>
<p>There are many issues with this approach. The primary problem is defining the partition. Our first proof followed this plan; later we found a simpler proof with better bounds, which I’ll now describe.</p>
<h3 id="decomposition-theorem-with-sets">Decomposition theorem with sets</h3>
<p>The insight is to work with distributions rather than sets.</p>
<p>There’s an idea in math that a theorem is true for sets, then it’s a special case of a theorem for functions - because sets just correspond to indicator functions.</p>
<p>For simulated tempering Langevin on a mixture of Gaussians, we don’t naturally have a decomposition of the state space, we do have a natural decomposition of the stationary distribution - namely the components of the mixture! Think of this as a “soft partition”.</p>
<p>So instead of partitioning <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, we decompose the Markov chain and stationary distribution. We prove a new Markov chain decomposition theorem that allows us to do this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(M_{\text{st}}\)</span> be a simulated tempering Markov chain (with stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) made up of Markov chains <span class="math inline">\(M_i,i\in [L]\)</span>. Suppose there is a decomposition <span class="math display">\[M_i(x,y)=\sum_{j=1}^mw_{ij}M_{ij}(x,y)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}\)</span> has stationary distribution <span class="math inline">\(p_{ij}\)</span>. If each <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}\)</span> mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and the projected chain mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(\ol C\)</span>, then the simulated tempering chain mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(O(C(\ol C +1))\)</span>.</p>
The projected chain is defined by
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align} L((i,j),(i,j')) &amp;=
\begin{cases}
\fc{w_{i,j'}}{\chi^2_{\text{sym}}(p_{i,j}||p_{i,j'})},&amp;i=i'\\
\fc{1}{\chi^2_{\text{sym}}(p_{i,j}||p_{i',j'}))}
,&amp;i'=i\pm 1\\
0,&amp;\text{else.}
\end{cases}
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2_{\text{sym}}(p||q)=\max\{\chi^2(p||q),\chi^2(q||p)\}\)</span> is the “symmetrized” <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> divergence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This theorem is where most of the magic lies, but it is also somewhat technical; see the paper for details.</p>
<h3 id="applying-the-decomposition-theorem">Applying the decomposition theorem</h3>
<p>We consider simulated tempering Langevin diffusion for <span class="math display">\[
\wt p_i \propto \sumo jm w_j \ub{\exp\pa{-\fc{\be_i \ve{x-\mu_j}^2}2}}{\wt p_{ij}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The Langevin chain decomposes into Langevin on the mixture components. By the decomposition theorem, if the Markov chain with respect to these components mixes rapidly, and the Markov chain on the “projected” chain mixes rapidly, then the simulated tempering chain mixes rapidly. We verify each of the two conditions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Langevin mixes rapidly for each <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_{ij}\)</span>, in time <span class="math inline">\(O(D^2)\)</span>, by Bakry-Emery, because the highest temperature is <span class="math inline">\(D^2\)</span>.</li>
<li>The projected chain mixes rapidly, in time <span class="math inline">\(O(L^2)\)</span>. To see this, note that by choosing the temperatures close enough, the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> distance between the gaussians in adjacent temperatures is at most a constant, and by choosing the highest temperature high enough, all the gaussians there are also close. Thus, the projected chain looks like <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> stacks of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> nodes, where the nodes in the same stack at adjacent temperatures have probability flow <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(1)\)</span> between them, and the subgraph consisting of nodes at the highest temperature mixes almost immediately.</li>
</ol>
<center>
<img src="pics/proj_chain.png" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>
<p>Thus the simulated tempering chain for <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_i\)</span> mixes in time <span class="math inline">\(O(L^2D^2)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="simulated-tempering-mixes-for-p">Simulated tempering mixes for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span></h3>
<p>But we need mixing for simulated tempering where the temperature is outside the sum, <span class="math display">\[
p_i \propto \pa{\sumo jm w_j \exp\pa{-\fc{\ve{x-\mu_j}^2}2}}^{\be_i}.
\]</span> This follows from mixing for <span class="math inline">\(\wt p_i\)</span>, plus the fact that the ratio <span class="math inline">\(p_i/\wt p_i\)</span> is bounded: <span class="math inline">\(\fc{p_i}{\wt p_i}\in [w_{\min}, \rc{w_{\min}}]\)</span>. We lose a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\rc{w_{\min}^2}\)</span>. This finishes the proof of the main result.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Beyond log-concavity” for sampling is the analogue of “beyond convexity” for optimization</li>
<li>There is a spectral decomposition lemma for Markov chains based on decomposing the <em>Markov chain</em> rather than just the <em>state space</em>, and that helps prove mixing for simulated tempering.</li>
<li>Provable sampling holds for a prototypical multimodal distribution: mixture of Gaussians.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="further-directions">Further directions</h2>
<p>Here are further directions and open questions we would like to explore. Feel free to get in touch if you have ideas!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How do we deal with gaussians with different variances? Equal (or approximately equal) variances appear to be necessary in the query model because of the “needle in a haystack” problem: the “attractor region” for a skinny gaussian could be exponentially small. However, other information may help.</li>
<li><p>Carry out average-case analysis for distributions of interest, such as posteriors of mixture models, Ising models, stochastic/censored block models, and RBM’s. These distributions are more complicated than a mixture of gaussians; for example, the posterior for gaussian mixture model is a sum of exponentially many gaussians.</p>
<p>One obstacle is that in many distributions <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of interest, <span class="math inline">\(p\propto e^{-f}\)</span> is not mixture of the probability distribution, but rather, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a combination of simpler functions. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(p\propto e^{-\sum_j w_jf_j}\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(p\propto \sum_j w_j e^{-f_j}\)</span>. When this combination happens in the exponent, the decomposition approach doesn’t work so well.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
It would be great to find other uses for our simulated tempering decomposition theorem - in principle the theorem could even apply when there are exponentially many modes, as long as we create a refining partition such that there is no “bottleneck” at any point.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
<li><p>What are the guarantees for other temperature heuristics used in practice, such as particle filters, annealed importance sampling, and parallel tempering? One undesirable property of simulated tempering is that it incurs a factor of <span class="math inline">\(O(L^2)\)</span> in the running time, where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the number of levels. Particle filters and annealed importance sampling move only from higher to lower temperature, and so only incur a factor of <span class="math inline">\(O(L)\)</span>.</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>For example, we could consider distributions in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^d\)</span>. Here, correlation decay plays a similar role to log-concavity in <span class="math inline">\(\R^n\)</span> in allowing a simple Markov chain, the Gibbs Markov chain, to mix rapidly.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The reason for the square-root scaling is that noise from Brownian motion scales as the square root of the time elapsed (the standard deviation of a sum of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> iid random variables scales as <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span>).<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Changing the temperature is just changing the scaling of the gradient step with respect to the noise.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>This definition is stated for continuous Markov chains. By rate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> I mean that the time between swaps is an exponential distribution with decay <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> (in other words, the times of the swaps forms a Poisson process). A version for discrete Markov chains is to swap with probability <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and to follow the current chain with probability <span class="math inline">\(1-\lambda\)</span>. Note that simulated tempering is traditionally defined for discrete Markov chains, but we will need the continuous version for our proof.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>They proceed by first bounding the spectral gap for parallel tempering, and then showing the gap for simulated tempering is lower-bounded in terms of that. However, in our experience, directly bounding the spectral gap for simulated tempering is easier.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Think of the downstairs combination as an OR combination, the upstairs one as a AND.<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>We stated it in the case where we had the same partition at every level. The more general form of the theorem works even if the partitions on different. The bound could be polynomial even if there are exponentially many components.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>
