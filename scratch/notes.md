# Math/CS notes

This page contains notes for current classes, seminars and talks. For more math notes (including the number theory textbook, class notes, math contest materials, etc.), see the [notes page on my website](http://holdenlee.github.io/#Math%20notes). Some of the source code is available on [github](https://github.com/holdenlee/mathnotes). (If it's not, email me.) To compile the source you'll need the [LaTeX template files](https://github.com/holdenlee/templates) (see the readme for instructions).

Note that most of these are sketchy - use at your own risk. (*) means this is a talk I gave.
