For much of my life, I operated as if there were an imaginary overseer watching over me.

The wrong way to think about God: "God couldn't have let this happen." If I do good things, God will reward me. If I do bad things, God will punish me. The is the part of religion which militant atheists, and also I, can't stand.

You can have the same conclusion taking an amoral stance: people who break the rules will be punished because society and particular heroes, uphold and protect certain virtues.

ex. when something criticizes you, you can refuse to acknowledge it or follow it, be angry at them in their head, visibly give them the cold shoulder

is that actually effective at signalling their loss of reputation in your eyes? probably not

it helps you more to incorporate the advice into the rest of your knowledge
there's no overseer who will tell them, "look, X is giving you the cold shoulder, you get -1 morality"

Ex. have to spend x hours on work/research per day to be a "good student". Like someone is watching you work. NO: if you know something isn't helpful, stop and find a better way. cf. age of em: overworking isn't useful, it's maladapted signalling
similarly for local optimization, ex. writing x words

Ex. This person hasn't signaled interest in me/what i represent/asked me the right questions, so I will not tell them more.

They get NO FEEDBACK. No overseer will tap them on the shoulder, say, "You got a C back in that interaction over there, because he wanted you to ask more about this, or show that you had a reaction to that, and you didn't, so you missed valuable connection."

The satisfaction of not telling them doesn't translate into any positive reward.

In contrast, saying more can have positive expected value---even though it might be useless, there's a chance that things would connect

Are you failing to heed advice or incorporate it simply because of the tone it was given? Translate it to be in a nice tone in your internal idiolect, how does it sound now? 

Pouting can be fun, but it doesn't help. The overseer will not penalize the other person. 

If you want to shame the other person, you have to do it explicitly, "I found the unsolicited comment you made to be rude" or "I don't appreciate being given feedback in this way. If you wish to give feedback, please do it in this fashion." Mollify it however you want.
