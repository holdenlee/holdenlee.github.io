I'm Holden Lee. I like math and writing, and I care deeply about education. To me, math and writing have a lot in common: they both call on us to be precise, and to ask and answer the "why" questions in the world. Neither of them require much more than pencil and paper, but that's enough to make beautiful things.

I graduated as a math major in the MIT Class of 2013. In 2013-2014, I went to the University of Cambridge for Part III of the Math Tripos. I am currently at Princeton for a Ph.D.
