Life has few principles but they are hard to carry out. When they become thrown around too much, we can become numb to them, and we need stories that make us feel (parables, fables, allegories, anecdotes) to see their truth again. Many people take one religious text, that may not be very large, and study it over and over again. 

TODO: add examples.
