**Proofs as obstacle avoidance**

When you look at a proof written without motivation, it may look like a very windy path:

How would someone think to come up with such a complex proof? The answer is nicely encapsulated by the [Simon's ant](http://everything2.com/title/Simon%2527s+ant) metaphor.

*"An ant, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. The apparent complexity of its behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which it finds itself".*

When you look at the obstacles to the proof, the path becomes a lot more motivated:

Thus, in teaching math it makes more sense to give proofs as successive approximations: first we're going to try to the most direct path,

[img[pics/obstacle3.png]]

we're going to see it doesn't work

[imgpics/obstacle4.png]]

and then we're going to successively refine our approach until we connect up our givens (A) and our desired (B).

(If you're reading a math proof that's given as in the first figure, then a good way to understand it is to try working on the problem yourself until you can see the shape of the obstacle, i.e., resupply the obstacle.)

**Why should proofs be written "backwards"?**

During an early stage in learning math, we learn that "you solve a problem backwards but you write it forwards." This is very well for writing up homework problems, where the goal is to create a watertight argument. However, if you want to communicate a proof in a way such that other people will remember it and be able to re-apply the methods, then you should show a proof as obstacle avoidance.

Some more reasons:

+ This refocuses math learning on the methods and the process, rather than the results. The methods are ultimately what transfers into tackling new problems.
+ It is much easier to remember a proof if you can make the correspondence between the elements of the proof and the obstacles in the problem -- which elements were introduced to combat which obstacles? You may have an illusion of understanding if you just see the windy path: when you put the text away, you can't remember the windy path because you don't know the rock it was trying to avoid!
+ It is much easier to extract a concise proof from a proof written as backwards, than to extract the motivation from a proof written forwards.

**Stories as obstacle avoidance**

The metaphor given by the picture occurs in a lot of different settings. For example, when writing a story, it would be no fun if the characters got from point A to point B immediately! Here the obstacles aren't simply existent like in math; the writer throws in a bunch of them to make the story more interesting, more windy... People like challenges; there is satisfaction to a path that makes it from A to B but is windy in the middle.
