Back to [Links](Links.html) or [Writing](Writing.html).

+ I find the two following websites immensely helpful for writing.
    + **oneword** (http://oneword.com/): Write about one word for one minute every day. It's great for getting my mind moving creatively, and insightful to read different people's perspectives.
        + My onewords are here: http://www.oneword.com/members/silversheep
    + **750words** (http:*www.750words.com): A site that encourages writing at least 750 pages every day.
+ **Reddit** (http:*www.reddit.com): I think the difference between reddit and quora is that quora is geared towards more intellectual questions, and reddit ias more about life experiences (good if you have a topic you want to write about and need to get a feel for the experience, not just the facts).
+ **Y Writer**: Software for writers (http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter5.html)
+ Daily writing inspiration (http://logodaedaly85.tumblr.com/)

For readers:

+ **Goodreads** (http:*www.goodreads.com)

To read:

+ Plain china (http:*www.plainchina.bennington.edu)
