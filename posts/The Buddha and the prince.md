A prince agrees to meditate with a monk. At the end of the meditation session, the prince asks the monk how he sees him. 

"You are a Buddha," the monk said. 

The prince was very happy: he must be great at this, if the first time he did this he was a Buddha already!" 

The monk asks the prince how he sees him. 

"You are a piece of shit," the prince said.

The prince tells his friend what happened, and the friend starts laughing. 

"What's so funny?"

"When you are Buddha, you see everything as Buddha," his friend said, "When you are shit you see everything as shit."
