# Basic Info

* Email: [holdenl@princeton.edu](mailto:holdenl@princeton.edu)
* Education:
    * (Current) <a href="https://www.math.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>, Ph.D. program in math 
    *<a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">																University of 									Cambridge</a>, 													MAST in Pure 												Math, 2014
    * <a href="http://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts 
		Institute of Technology</a>, B. Sc. Math, 2013
* I like thinking about mathematics and theoretical computer science, writing fiction, and improving education.

# Map

* If you'd like to find about about my <b>work</b>, look in the [Research](Research.html), [Math notes](Math notes.html), and [My teaching](My teaching) sections. There you can find all the papers and math notes I've written up.
* If you're a <b>math/CS student</b>, check out my [math notes](Math notes.html) I have available. Contributions are welcome, no matter how little (writing up math takes a lot of time!), especially for the number theory textbook. I've also put up some general advice for learning math and putting it in perspective (under construction).
* If you like <b>reading</b>, you can browse my fiction in the [[My writing]] section. Again, I'd love comments on any of this (and conversations are even better than comments). I'm always looking for people to share things with so feel free to drop me a line on anything you've written, too.
* If you're want to <b>find out about me as a person</b> or <b>learn my views on a variety of topics</b> then browse around, and keep reading below.
* If you like to see <b>what's new</b>, view my blog at **[http://holdenlee.github.io/blog](http://holdenlee.github.io/blog)**.

As my favorite professor [Patrick Winston](What I learned from Patrick Winston.html) says, you should talk to people! If you're interested in any of this stuff you see here (or fiercely opposed to anything), then I'd probably be interested in what you have to say! Shoot me an email at [holdenl@princeton.edu](mailto:holdenl@princeton.edu). (When you're deciding whether or not to talk to people, you should keep [three things in mind](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/3-things-we-dont-remember-enough).)

# About this wiki

This wiki is an ongoing project of mine to express my perspectives about a variety of things. In doing so, I hope to

* make a central "about me" page,
* organize my thoughts,
* start interesting conversations, and
* point out resources (books, websites) that have been useful to me.

I'd love to have a conversation about anything here. Note that all of my beliefs here are subject to change. I give many conjectures about life which I hope the reader will consider critically (and even argue against). They are not truths, but simply my best conjectures at the moment.

These notes are very incomplete. I'll keep adding to these ramblings, and hopefully they'll add up to something more and more complete over time.

Note that I'm updating the wiki in a haphazard fashion. If you'd like me to prioritize a certain part, let me know!


# Why this format?

One thing I don't like about blogging is that it's linear in time, and anything that fit into something linear is going to feel somewhat disorganized (like the high school math track). Instead, I'm attempting to put all my ramblings in one place and classify them in a tree-like structure, so you can easily traverse to the branch that you want to look at. There will be links to articles on my blog.
