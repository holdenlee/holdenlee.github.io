I am a Ph.D. student advised by Sanjeev Arora, focusing on machine learning from a theoretical perspective. Check out my [research](Research.html) and [blog](http://holdenlee.github.io/blog).

# Basic Info

* Education:
    * (Current) <a href="https://www.math.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>, Ph.D. program in math 
	* <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>, MAST in Pure Math, 2014
    * <a href="http://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, B. Sc. Math, 2013

I like math and writing, and I care deeply about education. To me, math and writing have a lot in common: they both call on us to be precise, and to ask and answer the "why" questions in the world. Neither of them require much more than pencil and paper, but that's enough to make beautiful things.
	
I'm fascinated by human and artificial intelligence. To me, the quest for AI is not just a mathematical and technological endeavor, but also a deeply introspective one.
