I am an assistant professor in applied mathematics and statistics at Johns Hopkins University. My research is in **machine learning** and **applied probability**. Check out my **[research](Research.html)** and **[blog](http://holdenlee.github.io/blog)**. My CV is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jndub09i2d5txst/holden_lee.pdf?dl=0). 

Timeline: 

* 2020-2022: Phillips Griffiths Research Assistant Professor in mathematics at Duke, supervised by [Jianfeng Lu](https://services.math.duke.edu/~jianfeng/) and [Rong Ge](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~rongge/).
* Fall 2021: I was a fellow at the [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley.
* 2019: I received my Ph.D. from Princeton, where I was advised by Sanjeev Arora. 

<!-- Phillip Griffiths Research Assistant Professor in Mathematics-->
Teaching: 

* Fall 2022 (JHU): EN.553.720 Probability Theory I.
* Spring 2022 (Duke): Math 340 (Advanced Introduction to Probability).
* Spring 2021: Math 230 (Probability).
* Spring 2020: [Math 361S (Numerical Analysis)](https://services.math.duke.edu/~holee/math361-2020/index.html)
<!--Here are links to [ML theory at Princeton](http://mltheory.cs.princeton.edu/) and

<!-- I will be at the [IAS](http://math.ias.edu) in Fall 2019 to participate in the special year on Theoretical Machine Learning. In Spring 2020, I will be starting as a Phillip Griffiths Research Assistant Professor in [Mathematics at Duke University](https://math.duke.edu/).-->

# Basic Info

* Education:
    * <a href="https://www.math.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>, Ph.D. in Math, 2019
	* <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>, MAST in Pure Math, 2014
    * <a href="http://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, B. Sc. Math, 2013

I like math and writing, and I care deeply about education. To me, math and writing have a lot in common: they both call on us to be precise, and to ask and answer the "why" questions in the world. Neither of them require much more than pencil and paper, but that's enough to make beautiful things.
	
I'm fascinated by human and artificial intelligence. To me, the quest for AI is not just a mathematical and technological endeavor, but also a deeply introspective one.
