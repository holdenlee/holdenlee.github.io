Nice Guy is the idea of "if you work hard enough you get a reward". This isn't limited to relationships. I was being a Nice Guy in math competitions - if I just practice enough hours everyday, then I'll make the IMO, and if not, the world is just screwed up! I was a [Stage Two Nice Guy (TM)](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/02/24/the-extremely-long-nice-guys-series-i-wrote-in-like-2012/).
<!--  I lamented about why hard work is not interconvertible to relationship points.-->

Nice Guy is not an unchangeable part of a person, but rather a behavior/mindset that one can grow out of.

*Nice Guy is the wrong attitude in life*. "Deserve" is the wrong rhetoric. The world doesn't change because you use the word "deserve."
