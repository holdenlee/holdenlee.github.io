What do math and writing have in common? See my post [The math-writing divide](http://holdenlee.wordpress.com/2013/09/15/the-mathwriting-divide/).

To communicate and teach math more effectively, one thing mathematicians can do is learn to tell stories. (Watch Tyler DeWitt's [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/tyler_dewitt_hey_science_teachers_make_it_fun.html) about telling stories to teach science. Leonid mentions this in his interview ([transcript](http://web.mit.edu/uma/www/mmm/leo-for-website.docx), [recording](http://mathophilia.com/turning-the-tables-an-interview-with-yours-truly/)), Simon mentions it in his teaching statement. A story is similar to Dan Myer's [3-act math](http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~simon/teachingstatement.pdf).  ViHart tells wonderful mathematical stories, for example, about [life on a Mobius strip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdEsouIXGM).)
