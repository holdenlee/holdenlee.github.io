Everyone has their own personal vocabulary - their handle on things that they often think about. I think it's great to share our personal vocabularies; they reveal a lot about the way we individually perceive the world.

The words may be words that already exist but are used with a different connotation or sense, or new coinings altogether.

I like making up words. Mostly I use them in talking  to or writing for myself. Here is a list of vocabulary I have come up with, with varying levels of usage. Commonly used ones are bolded.

+ anticipointed = disappointment when I'm looking forward to meeting/talking to someone and they cancel. Something expected and anticipated did not happen.
+ anot = and the opposite. (bitter anot = bittersweet)
+ atomize = break into the smallest components
+ awkend = not knowing when a conversation actually ends, and so being awkward at the end.
+ body-memory = maintaining bad posture because if you move, you'll forget what you were thinking about.
+ **bosch** = interjection form of "botch"
+ **centralize** = a centralizing concept is one that you frame other concepts in terms of
+ **cold-blooded** = (of a person) taking on the character of the people around
+ cophemism = A codephrase for something socially embarrassing. "could you remind us what that means?" which can be code for "I forgot. What is this?"
+ coversation = conversation you're waiting to be over
+ didate = a second conversation that's awkward
+ **dismember** = lose track of a thought. "My thought just got dismembered."
+ dismemophobia = fear of dismemberment (cf. athazagoraphobia)
+ -eto = suffix used referring to a baby step for something. Often used with the Esperanto word, ex. skribeto. Aims to replace apologetic thoughts like "I tried to write a poem, but instead just wrote a lot of disconnected words" with "I wrote poemetoj (poemetos)."
+ eyetracted = when you want to be distracted, and for no reason read random words or posters around you
+ frocon = Conversations that are low in temperature. "We froconned." How about, inversation?
+ gigotos (syndrome) = grass is greener on the other side
+ **generative** = "I wish I'm more generative."
+ improversation = Can every conversation be walking off a ledge? Parachutes are free in dream-land. (See [Can we raise the temperature?](Can we raise the temperature.html)
+ **index-card** = "I have it index-carded." To hold a concept clearly in mind as if with an index card, so that you can easily give a summary/elevator pitch. See [index cards](index cards.html).
+ morrow =like "tomorrow" but means, "the next awake-day for me." Solves the ambiguity of what "tomorrow" means if it's past midnight. In this case "morrow" means today, but after I go to sleep and wake up.
+ mundete = mundane tete-a-tete, conversation where two people go back and forth asking the usual questions
+ **[myopic](X vs Myopic X.html) [x]** = motivated by x, not doing things that help one achieve x if they involve stepping outside of x for a moment. Ex. myopic creativity, egoism, rationality.
+ nitefooted = lightfooted
+ **noncontradiction** = when you figure out that two seemingly contradictory things are not contradictory. Taken from Ayn Rand.
+ (RAM) random-access memory = the memory of a generative person.
+ postor = opposite of impostor
+ **show-show** = being social for the purpose of gaining status
+ settledom = the state of achieving a settled personality. From [here](http://ofthoughtformsanddaemons.tumblr.com/).
+ spectronomy = like a dichotomy, but more of a spectrum
+ switch-tasking (context-switching) = switching between multiple tasks. Contrast multi-tasking, which means doing multiple tasks at the same time
+ **sollocked** = locked into one train of thought or activity. Opposite of webbed out.
+ **unudamulte** = May this be the first of many. Said after a good experience that you haven't had much of before. Like a more mature version of breaking out into the "First time in forever" song.
+ **thread** = a clear thought-path to follow. See [Webs and threads](Webs and threads.html).
+ **webbed out** = mind going all over the place
+ whameans = (contraction) whatever that means
+ whectrum = to what degree; where on the spectrum
