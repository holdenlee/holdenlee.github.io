Why do people do what they do? It comes down to three things: feeling, necessity, and habit. You do things because you want to, you do things because you need to, and you do things because you've always done it that way.

When you realize this, you can first *observe*: categorize the things that you do. You can then *reengineer*: think about your goals and try to make these reasons happen in the steps towards those goals. Make it fun. Trick yourself with necessity: make yourself responsible for various tasks, imagine consequences. Develop the right habits.
