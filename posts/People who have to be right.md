People like to be right, and go about it in two ways: (1) try to modify what they do be be in the right, or (2) try to dictate what "right" is so as to coincide with what they do. 

About this second tendency: people see things in terms of black or white, guilty or blameless. But things are gray - we can do things without ill intent that still hurt other people, and it's not so important whether we are blameless, and more important to understand, ok, now there is a problem, let me see what I can do to help fix it.

When two people refuse because of "honor" to reconcile because they "did nothing wrong," the disagreement can just escalate. "I refuse to pay/apologize/etc. unless it's proven that I did something wrong."
