The myopic x problem is the problem where I'm motivated by x, but I *cling* to x, and won't do things that help me achieve x if they involve stepping outside of x for a moment. So being myopically x hinders my accomplishing x. I have the myopic egotism problem: when becoming a better person (ultimate goal is egotistic) means forgetting myself and being open and listening to other people (which involves temporarily suspending egotism), I have trouble. The myopic creativity problem is when I put myself in front of an empty screen and try to write, when coming up with something to write involves reading, watching, and studying books/movies/etc., talking to and doing things with people, and learning more about the world. Myopic egotism and myopic creativity together make me think everything I do should come from myself, and prevent me from "standing on the shoulders of giants."



(On friendship and love I think I have the opposite problem: I'm farsighted, looking in the distance, wanting these connections because of the benefits they will bring, rather than wanting them in themselves. I.e. learning:creating::friendship:(everything friendship leads to), where I'm myopic in the second component, so I overlook the first. As a contrast, [Justine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13037.Justine) is about myopic love.

The thing with ulterior motives (do A in order to B) is that although I can't deny their existence, I have to get myself to *not think about* B and get myself to *truly love* A. The only way to truly be knowledgeable is to love learning; the only way to truly enrich myself is to cultivate love and friendship, without thinking of these as for the ulterior purpose of cultivating myself.)

It's the same with research: I spend too much time trying to get an idea to work, so I can publish it and Have Done Something New! when instead I should ask myself things like, is this likely to work? what's the best use of time? what things should I understand better before I try to come up with something new? what foundational things should I be learning?

[Why do I think](http://lesswrong.com/lw/oh/righting_a_wrong_question/) this is circular? Because I think, "once I create something truly new, then I'll have the confidence that I'm not just a rehash, and then I can go out and learn stuff without worrying whether I can be original." This means that I shouldn't change my current course---I should keep spending a lot of my effort on creating, rather than putting the creating aside. The circularity comes from (1) creating requires me to learn/absorb stuff, (2) I don't want to learn/absorb a lot of stuff until I've proved that I can create something.

The myopic creativity that I'm talking about, I think, is a bastardized version of what an artist would call "creativity." [A lot of creativity is remix](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/08/01/networked-knowledge-combinatorial-creativity/). It's being "my brain is open": not a flow of information *out*, but a flow of information *in*. I try to tell myself that life is remix. But I have a hard time having faith in it.

The catch-22 is illusory though. (1) is true regardless of whether I want to believe it or not. (2) is in my head: it's a "want" not a "need." (Like men saying they have to "satisfy their needs," ugh.)

How is this related to Ayn Rand style egoism? I like her teachings. But I think one has to be very careful because the idea of egoism is easy to misinterpret. It's easy to [confuse egoism and egotism](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/7482/whats-the-difference-between-egotism-and-egoism); I use "egotism" to refer to "myopic egoism." Egoism, done right, includes a (sometimes difficult) realization that even when the end goal is benefiting yourself, you'll have to step outside yourself to accomplish it---you'll need your friends' help, you'll need to be humble and learn from the masters. Egotism is refusing to step outside yourself for even a moment, and it remains egotism even if you try to label it "egoism."

The essay [Joy in Discovery](http://lesswrong.com/lw/os/joy_in_discovery/): that's exactly the attitude I need to have. This reminds me of another Ayn Rand bit: she always says that when you enjoy something, that pleasure is *yours*. She affirms that [the way you relate to something making you happy] cannot be taken away from you. So even if you're not a good painter at all, and you don't own any works of art, you can walk in the museum and get a *uniquely personal experience*.
