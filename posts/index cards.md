Why index cards?

+ They're like little pensieves: thoughts I might mull over for a long time, crystallized to fit on an index card (something I can look over quickly), so I don't have to retrace my steps.
+ An idea is something that fits on an index card but encompasses a lot more when you think about it.
+ For things I commonly think about, it's inefficient to grope for a way to express it every time it comes up - an index card is like an elevator pitch.
+ Our ability to conceptify, including building larger concepts out of smaller ones, is a key to our intelligence.
