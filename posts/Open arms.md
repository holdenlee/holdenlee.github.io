I like it better, when I think that when someone shares an experience, they're on the other side of a field, a goal line, with open arms, looking at me, saying, you can do it too, we're waiting for you on this side.

I don't know how to learn from a teacher who doesn't treat students as equals, with the faith that they can be as successful as em.

Contrast: the kind of person who is at the finish line, disdaining the people who aren't there yet. When you see those people, you, animalistically, refuse to run while they're watching. You only want to run when they're not around, when they're not laughing daggers into your ego.
