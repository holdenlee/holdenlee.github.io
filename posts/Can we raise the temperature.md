See this great post [Honing mode vs Jamming mode (in conversation)](http://malcolmocean.com/2016/05/honing-mode-vs-jamming-mode/) by Malcolm Ocean.

Sometimes I am disappointed by conversations and social interactions, thinking them not as satisfying as imagined conversations and interactions. In imagined conversations, people say what they truly think.[^f1] They say out loud "I am a plant," if they feel like a plant, not matter how irrational the thought is. In real life, they excuse themselves, "I'm afraid I don't feel so well," and then sit alone and mull, *Why did I think I was a plant just now? Is there something wrong with me?*.

[^f1]: The rationalist community calls these "aliefs".

The solution isn't to not converse, but to say and accept these thoughts which are this [different kind of true](There are two types of truth in the world.html).

+ Logical people filter what they say with logic: does this make sense? (Sometimes, they are so logical that the filter is unnecessary. The Hebbian connections of literal untruths have already been broken.) 
+ The artists say what they think. They cherish what they think and what they say. If it is wrong, no matter, it is holy. Thoughts are holy.
