> "Be yourself." 

This sentence can be interpreted different ways. 
<!--The "growth mindset" seems to contradict the statement "you can't change who you are."-->

"Be natural" and "be yourself" can have negative connotations when it's associated with fixed rather than growth mindset. 

It has positive connotations when it means something like, "everyone has their own unique objective function, that only you really know. There are things that you do simply because you enjoy them, things you like that mean the world to you. Don't let other people change those things. Value your terminal desires."

Don't embrace your flaws---you can fix them. Don't be who you are---be who you aspire to be.
But there are certain parts of yourself that are so you, that it would be a kind of suicide to change or suppress them. These parts are often undervalued by other people.
