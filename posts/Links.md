I keep track of the blogs, podcasts, etc. I follow at workflowy. ([Websites](https://workflowy.com/s/VOwtHYFTYr), [Day-by-day reading](https://workflowy.com/s/wL3CyEXpHY#/d1a52d188a8f)) I recommend a program such as [feedly](https://feedly.com/) to collect all the blogs you want to follow in one place.

My feedly OPML (which you can import to a feed reader) is [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27883775/feedly.opml).
