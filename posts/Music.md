+ [Aryuna](https://aryuna.bandcamp.com/album/aryunas-hecking-good-song-collection-2): vocaloid, emotional <!-- The songs are all sung in a cheerful, vocaloid voice, but the lyrics are disturbing. I found the dissonance fascinating, attractive. The songs are more powerful because of that – they stick with me because I couldn’t put it nicely in a box.

The first song in the album is called Sirenomelia. The lyrics are in 3 different languages. Because most of it wasn’t in English, after hearing the song I was very surprised to read the translation and find that it was completely not what I imagined.-->

<!--
I like a variety of music, and the music I listen to is always changing -- for an accurate picture see my starred list on Spotify. (I like to find what songs my friends are listening to and and listen to those. They usually have better taste in music than I do.)

Some music I like:

+ Owl City -- I like Owl City's songs because they usually express some kind of searching in life, but they're sung by a person who hasn't lost wonder and hope.

    + Fireflies, my favorite song -- The fireflies are dreams. Stuff you want to accomplish in your life. When you're young you have millions of them. When you grow older you realize you can't possibly achieve them all. But you keep a few of your dreams ("saved a few and keep them in a jar").

+ The Naked and Famous (Punching in a Dream)
