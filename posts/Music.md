I like a variety of music, and the music I listen to is always changing -- for an accurate picture see my starred list on Spotify. (I like to find what songs my friends are listening to and and listen to those. They usually have better taste in music than I do.)

Some music I like:

+ Owl City -- I like Owl City's songs because they usually express some kind of searching in life, but they're sung by a person who hasn't lost wonder and hope.

    + Fireflies, my favorite song -- The fireflies are dreams. Stuff you want to accomplish in your life. When you're young you have millions of them. When you grow older you realize you can't possibly achieve them all. But you keep a few of your dreams ("saved a few and keep them in a jar").

+ LIGHTS

+ The Naked and Famous (Punching in a Dream)

+ [Human](Human.html), by The Killers

+ Alternative rock: Muse, Death Cab for Cutie

+ Time-bending, Swingset chain, by [Loquat](Loquat.html)

+ [Closer to fine](Closer to fine.html), by Indigo Girls

+ fantasy/videogame-esque

    + music from Newgrounds ([http://www.newgrounds.com](http://www.newgrounds.com)) artists: HalcyonicFalconX, dimrain47, ParagonX9

+ soundtracks, like Miyazaki

+ Take me home country road. Some folk and country

+ calming/nature music for de-stressing

+ Raffi (children's songs! good memories)

+ some random songs tied to memories (like the ones my roommates played during mathcamp)

+ DDR songs
