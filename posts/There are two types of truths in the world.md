Story-truth is truer sometimes than happening-truth. *Tim O'Brien, The Things They Carried.*

There are two types of truth in the world:
1. **reason** (aka **logos**; science, mathematics, logic, etc.) because it helps you accomplish material things (planes fly not because we believe they can fly, but because they were constructed using principles from physics, chemistry, etc.)
1. **feeling** (aka **mythos**; stories, belief, etc.) because what makes people feel is what makes people do things (see [Why do people do what they do?](Why do people do what they do?.html)), and that can be more effective than a recipe that tells them *exactly* how to do things but not give them the motivation to do so. 
Denying feeling can be as bad as denying actual truths, because then there's a discord between what you feel and what you think you feel, causing you to lose touch with reality. It's important to acknowledge both feeling and reason.
