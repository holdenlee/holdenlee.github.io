I'm keeping a list of cool things to do around Durham! Contrary to what some might say, there's a lot to explore without a car.

Suggestions welcome, drop me a line! 

+ Film
	+ [Screen and Society]() (Duke, free!)
	+ []() (Duke, free!)
+ Duke botanical gardens
+ Dining at Duke - is really good! Much better than other colleges I've been to!
+ Lemur center
+ Vegan restaurants: Earth to Us, Souly Vegan. 
+ Durham scrap exchange
+ Mardi Gras
+ Motorco
+ Eno River State Park: Bikeable from downtown Durham; go down Cole Mill Road. It's the best kind of up-and-down country road where you can relax on the downhill parts.
