UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Based on books I've read, I'm making a list of "books to read when you need x." Wouldn't it be great if people recommended books to each other based on what they feel like the people needed in their lives? This is my attempt.

+ Often people are so dishonest and indirect. Caring too much about feelings and not about actual progress, for example, rewarding bad work. Read Ayn Rand (but then read something else, too).
+ What is the point of religion? Maybe the world would be better off without it. Read [Nation, Terry Pratchett](Nation, Terry Pratchett.html).
+ I don't know how to embrace uncertainty in life, not knowing exactly where I'm going. I guess I've built my life around being certain, and it's hard to give up. Read Murakami.
