I am a Ph.D. student at Princeton working with Sanjeev Arora ([research group page](http://unsupervised.cs.princeton.edu/)).

I focus on machine learning theory, and also have broad interests in theoretical computer science and related math.

# Research interests

* Machine learning: Although many machine learning problems are NP-complete, the instances that arise in reality are a restricted subset that is often more tractable. What hidden structure do these instances, and how can we design algorithms to take advantage of it? (See [Arora's course](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring15/cos598D/).)
