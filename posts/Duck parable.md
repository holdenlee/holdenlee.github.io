Once there was a duck, who, when all the other ducks were frolicking, spent his time reading and learning. He disdained all the other ducks who cared nothing for hard work and discipline. All the ducks get slaughtered for food. The ghost of the duck says: don't I deserve something more, for all my hard work? How come I get the same fate? A voice says: How you spend your days is your individual freedom. You must spend your days in the way that is satisfying to you, not in expectation of judgment.
