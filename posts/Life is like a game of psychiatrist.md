It's like a game where you don't know the rules, where it seems that everyone else knows the rules, and you have to figure it out as you go along. You can't just stand there and refuse to act

&
1.8212;but you have to not be afraid to do stupid things, because later, you'll look back at those mistake and have a good laugh about them.
