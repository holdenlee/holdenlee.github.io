Good art doesn't make an argument, it presents a dilemma.

Art is that it doesn't give definite answers to questions, but rather breaks open the box you think inside when considering a question. Not giving an answer forces you to think through the questions yourself. A conclusion reached by oneself is a lot more powerful than one fed to you.
