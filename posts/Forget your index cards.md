Make lots of [index cards](index cards.html), and then forget them.

Index cards are pensieves. They will remember for you, even when you forget.

If you keep them in mind at all times, you're holding many little stones, and don't have the space to come up with new things.

A musician learns music theory in order to compose and play well, but doesn't think about it consciously in the actual act of playing.
