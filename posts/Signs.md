I think so much of life is determined by signs of various things. When a sign is negative, you keep regressing unless you apply willpower. When a sign is positive, you keep going forward, even if it's at a slow pace. So it's important to try and make the signs of things that are important to do, positive. 

(The sign may be indicative of the personality of your [shadow](Shadow.html).)

There are two ways to get yourself to do something: you make a focused effort, so that you make progress even against a negative sign. Or you can flip the sign, so you naturally, without effort, make a little progress every day.
