See my post here for the story of an online gaming community, and why it's relevant in thinking about MOOCs. [http://holdenlee.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/communities-of-play/](http://holdenlee.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/communities-of-play/.html).

teacher:students :: game developer:gaming community

The relationship between a teacher and a student in a MOOC can be likened to that between a game developer and a gaming community: if the game allows enough freedom (i.e., is "lego-like"), the gaming community can take the game far beyond what the creator imagined, and it would do good for the creator to take it into account when updating the game. Doug Holton suggests a [MOOLE](http://edtechdev.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/whats-the-problem-with-moocs/): an educational experience modeled after an online gaming community that doesn't have clear boundaries in time.
