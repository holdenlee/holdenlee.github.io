> "An artist does not live a personal life as we do, he hides it, forcing us to go to his books if we wish to touch the true source of his feelings... Underneath all his preoccupations with sex, society, religion, etc. there is, quite simple, a man tortured beyond endurance by the lack of tenderness in the world." --Justine, Lawrence Durrell

Writers want people to talk after reading their writing. Not simply about style---though that is interesting and helpful---but thoughts more spiritual in nature. What did the reader think about after reading? It doesn't even have to be related. Just say what you think about... because people rarely say what they think about.
