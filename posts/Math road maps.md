I think it's immensely helpful to gather up "road maps" of different math subjects. (See [Ideas to implement](Ideas to implement.html).) Here are lists of math book recommendations on the web.

+ John Baez, math and physics [http://www.ucr.edu/home/baez/books.htm](http://www.ucr.edu/home/baez/books.htm) 
+ Qiaochu Yuan [http://qchu.wordpress.com/reading-recommendations/](http://qchu.wordpress.com/reading-recommendations/)

What would be really useful for me is a road map for each math subject, and a list of book reviews gets us halfway there. Firstly, each subject consists of many topics, and different books cover some topics but not others; second, there may be various ways of viewing the subject and deriving the theorems, and it's good to list out which books take which kind of approach; third, some books are better for learning and some better for reference. Finally, I think in this age such a list no longer has to be constrained to print books; there are more and more electronic resources available for all the subjects. With technology I feel learning now has more of a "scavenging" component -- sometimes a blog post, or a student's thesis, for instance, can be very useful.
